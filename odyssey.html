<p>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<p>AL PROFESSORE</p>
<p>CAV. BIAGIO INGROIA,</p>
<p>PREZIOSO ALLEATO</p>
<p>L‚ÄôAUTORE RICONOSCENTE.</p>
<p>PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</p>
<p>This translation is intended to supplement a work entitled ‚ÄúThe</p>
<p>Authoress of the Odyssey‚Äù,</p>
<p>which I published in 1897. I could not give</p>
<p>the whole ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù in that book without making it unwieldy,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>therefore epitomised my translation,</p>
<p>which was already completed and</p>
<p>which I now publish in full.</p>
<p>I shall not here argue the two main points dealt with in the work just</p>
<p>mentioned; I have nothing either to add to,</p>
<p>or to withdraw from,</p>
<p>what I</p>
<p>have there written. The points in question are:</p>
<p>(1) that the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù was written entirely at,</p>
<p>and drawn entirely</p>
<p>from,</p>
<p>the place now called Trapani on the West Coast of Sicily,</p>
<p>alike</p>
<p>as regards the Phaeacian and the Ithaca scenes; while the voyages of</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>when once he is within easy reach of Sicily,</p>
<p>solve themselves</p>
<p>into a periplus of the island,</p>
<p>practically from Trapani back to</p>
<p>Trapani,</p>
<p>via the Lipari islands,</p>
<p>the Straits of Messina,</p>
<p>and the island</p>
<p>of Pantellaria.</p>
<p>(2) That the poem was entirely written by a very young woman,</p>
<p>who lived</p>
<p>at the place now called Trapani,</p>
<p>and introduced herself into her work</p>
<p>under the name of Nausicaa.</p>
<p>The main arguments on which I base the first of these somewhat</p>
<p>startling contentions,</p>
<p>have been prominently and repeatedly before the</p>
<p>English and Italian public ever since they appeared (without rejoinder)</p>
<p>in the ‚ÄúAthenaeum‚Äù for January 30 and February 20,</p>
<p>1892. Both</p>
<p>contentions were urged (also without rejoinder) in the Johnian ‚ÄúEagle‚Äù</p>
<p>for the Lent and October terms of the same year. Nothing to which I</p>
<p>should reply has reached me from any quarter,</p>
<p>and knowing how anxiously</p>
<p>I have endeavoured to learn the existence of any flaws in my argument,</p>
<p>I begin to feel some confidence that,</p>
<p>did such flaws exist,</p>
<p>I should</p>
<p>have heard,</p>
<p>at any rate about some of them,</p>
<p>before now. Without,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>for a moment pretending to think that scholars generally</p>
<p>acquiesce in my conclusions,</p>
<p>I shall act as thinking them little likely</p>
<p>so to gainsay me as that it will be incumbent upon me to reply,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>shall confine myself to translating the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù for English readers,</p>
<p>with such notes as I think will be found useful. Among these I would</p>
<p>especially call attention to one on xxii. 465-473 which Lord Grimthorpe</p>
<p>has kindly allowed me to make public.</p>
<p>I have repeated several of the illustrations used in ‚ÄúThe Authoress of</p>
<p>the Odyssey‚Äù,</p>
<p>and have added two which I hope may bring the outer court</p>
<p>of Ulysses‚Äô house more vividly before the reader. I should like to</p>
<p>explain that the presence of a man and a dog in one illustration is</p>
<p>accidental,</p>
<p>and was not observed by me till I developed the negative.</p>
<p>In an appendix I have also reprinted the paragraphs explanatory of the</p>
<p>plan of Ulysses‚Äô house,</p>
<p>together with the plan itself. The reader is</p>
<p>recommended to study this plan with some attention.</p>
<p>In the preface to my translation of the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù I have given my views</p>
<p>as to the main principles by which a translator should be guided,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>need not repeat them here,</p>
<p>beyond pointing out that the initial liberty</p>
<p>of translating poetry into prose involves the continual taking of more</p>
<p>or less liberty throughout the translation; for much that is right in</p>
<p>poetry is wrong in prose,</p>
<p>and the exigencies of readable prose are the</p>
<p>first things to be considered in a prose translation. That the reader,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>may see how far I have departed from strict construe,</p>
<p>I will</p>
<p>print here Messrs. Butcher and Lang‚Äôs translation of the sixty lines or</p>
<p>so of the ‚ÄúOdyssey.‚Äù Their translation runs:</p>
<p>Tell me,</p>
<p>Muse,</p>
<p>of that man,</p>
<p>so ready at need,</p>
<p>who wandered far and</p>
<p>wide,</p>
<p>after he had sacked the sacred citadel of Troy,</p>
<p>and many were the</p>
<p>men whose towns he saw and whose mind he learnt,</p>
<p>yea,</p>
<p>and many the woes</p>
<p>he suffered in his heart on the deep,</p>
<p>striving to win his own life and</p>
<p>the return of his company. Nay,</p>
<p>but even so he saved not his company,</p>
<p>though he desired it sore. For through the blindness of their own</p>
<p>hearts they perished,</p>
<p>fools,</p>
<p>who devoured the oxen of Helios Hyperion:</p>
<p>but the god took from them their day of returning. Of these things,</p>
<p>goddess,</p>
<p>daughter of Zeus,</p>
<p>whencesoever thou hast heard thereof,</p>
<p>declare thou even unto us.</p>
<p>Now all the rest,</p>
<p>as many as fled from sheer destruction,</p>
<p>were at</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>and had escaped both war and sea,</p>
<p>but Odysseus only,</p>
<p>craving</p>
<p>for his wife and for his homeward path,</p>
<p>the lady nymph Calypso</p>
<p>held,</p>
<p>that fair goddess,</p>
<p>in her hollow caves,</p>
<p>longing to have him</p>
<p>for her lord. But when now the year had come in the courses of the</p>
<p>seasons,</p>
<p>wherein the gods had ordained that he should return home</p>
<p>to Ithaca,</p>
<p>not even there was he quit of labours,</p>
<p>not even among</p>
<p>his own; but all the gods had pity on him save Poseidon,</p>
<p>who raged</p>
<p>continually against godlike Odysseus,</p>
<p>till he came to his own</p>
<p>country. Howbeit Poseidon had now departed for the distant</p>
<p>Ethiopians,</p>
<p>the Ethiopians that are sundered in twain,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>uttermost of men,</p>
<p>abiding some where Hyperion sinks and some where</p>
<p>he rises. There he looked to receive his hecatomb of bulls and</p>
<p>rams,</p>
<p>there he made merry sitting at the feast,</p>
<p>but the other gods</p>
<p>were gathered in the halls of Olympian Zeus. Then among them the</p>
<p>father of men and gods began to speak,</p>
<p>for he bethought him in his</p>
<p>heart of noble Aegisthus,</p>
<p>whom the son of Agamemnon,</p>
<p>far-famed</p>
<p>Orestes,</p>
<p>slew. Thinking upon him he spake out among the Immortals:</p>
<p>‚ÄòLo you now,</p>
<p>how vainly mortal men do blame the gods! For of us</p>
<p>they say comes evil,</p>
<p>whereas they even of themselves,</p>
<p>through the</p>
<p>blindness of their own hearts,</p>
<p>have sorrows beyond that which is</p>
<p>ordained. Even as of late Aegisthus,</p>
<p>beyond that which was</p>
<p>ordained,</p>
<p>took to him the wedded wife of the son of Atreus,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>killed her lord on his return,</p>
<p>and that with sheer doom before his</p>
<p>eyes,</p>
<p>since we had warned him by the embassy of Hermes the</p>
<p>keen-sighted,</p>
<p>the slayer of Argos,</p>
<p>that he should neither kill the</p>
<p>man,</p>
<p>nor woo his wife. For the son of Atreus shall be avenged at</p>
<p>the hand of Orestes,</p>
<p>so soon as he shall come to man‚Äôs estate and</p>
<p>long for his own country. So spake Hermes,</p>
<p>yet he prevailed not on</p>
<p>the heart of Aegisthus,</p>
<p>for all his good will; but now hath he paid</p>
<p>one price for all.‚Äô</p>
<p>And the goddess,</p>
<p>grey-eyed Athene,</p>
<p>answered him,</p>
<p>saying: ‚ÄòO father,</p>
<p>our father Cronides,</p>
<p>throned in the highest; that man assuredly</p>
<p>lies in a death that is his due; so perish likewise all who work</p>
<p>such deeds! But my heart is rent for wise Odysseus,</p>
<p>the hapless</p>
<p>one,</p>
<p>who far from his friends this long while suffereth affliction</p>
<p>in a sea-girt isle,</p>
<p>where is the navel of the sea,</p>
<p>a woodland isle,</p>
<p>and therein a goddess hath her habitation,</p>
<p>the daughter of the</p>
<p>wizard Atlas,</p>
<p>who knows the depths of every sea,</p>
<p>and himself</p>
<p>upholds the tall pillars which keep earth and sky asunder. His</p>
<p>daughter it is that holds the hapless man in sorrow: and ever with</p>
<p>soft and guileful tales she is wooing him to forgetfulness of</p>
<p>Ithaca. But Odysseus yearning to see if it were but the smoke leap</p>
<p>upwards from his own land,</p>
<p>hath a desire to die. As for thee,</p>
<p>thine</p>
<p>heart regardeth it not at all,</p>
<p>Olympian! What! Did not Odysseus by</p>
<p>the ships of the Argives make thee free offering of sacrifice in</p>
<p>the wide Trojan land? Wherefore wast thou then so wroth with him,</p>
<p>O</p>
<p>Zeus?‚Äô</p>
<p>The ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù (as every one knows) abounds in passages borrowed from</p>
<p>the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù; I had wished to print these in a slightly different type,</p>
<p>with marginal references to the ‚ÄúIliad,</p>
<p>‚Äù and had marked them to this</p>
<p>end in my MS. I found,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that the translation would be thus</p>
<p>hopelessly scholasticised,</p>
<p>and abandoned my intention. I would</p>
<p>nevertheless urge on those who have the management of our University</p>
<p>presses,</p>
<p>that they would render a great service to students if they</p>
<p>would publish a Greek text of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù with the Iliadic passages</p>
<p>printed in a different type,</p>
<p>and with marginal references. I have given</p>
<p>the British Museum a copy of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù with the Iliadic passages</p>
<p>underlined and referred to in MS.; I have also given an ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù marked</p>
<p>with all the Odyssean passages,</p>
<p>and their references; but copies of</p>
<p>both the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù and ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù so marked ought to be within easy reach</p>
<p>of all students.</p>
<p>Any one who at the present day discusses the questions that have arisen</p>
<p>round the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù since Wolf‚Äôs time,</p>
<p>without keeping it well before his</p>
<p>reader‚Äôs mind that the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù was demonstrably written from one</p>
<p>single neighbourhood,</p>
<p>and hence (even though nothing else pointed to</p>
<p>this conclusion) presumably by one person only‚Äîthat it was written</p>
<p>certainly before 750,</p>
<p>and in all probability before 1000 B.C.‚Äîthat the</p>
<p>writer of this very early poem was demonstrably familiar with the</p>
<p>‚ÄúIliad‚Äù as we now have it,</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">borrowing as freely from those books whose</span>
<p>genuineness has been most impugned,</p>
<p>as from those which are admitted to</p>
<p>be by Homer‚Äîany one who fails to keep these points before his readers,</p>
<p>is hardly dealing equitably by them. Any one on the other hand,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>will mark his ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù and his ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù from the copies in the British</p>
<p>Museum above referred to,</p>
<p>and who will draw the only inference that</p>
<p>common sense can draw from the presence of so many identical passages</p>
<p>in both poems,</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>I believe,</p>
<p>find no difficulty in assigning their</p>
<p>proper value to a large number of books here and on the Continent that</p>
<p>at present enjoy considerable reputations. Furthermore,</p>
<p>and this</p>
<p>perhaps is an advantage better worth securing,</p>
<p>he will find that many</p>
<p>puzzles of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù cease to puzzle him on the discovery that they</p>
<p>arise from over-saturation with the ‚ÄúIliad.‚Äù</p>
<p>Other difficulties will also disappear as soon as the development of</p>
<p>the poem in the writer‚Äôs mind is understood. I have dealt with this at</p>
<p>some length in pp. 251-261 of ‚ÄúThe Authoress of the Odyssey‚Äù. Briefly,</p>
<p>the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù consists of two distinct poems: (1) The Return of</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>which alone the Muse is asked to sing in the opening lines of</p>
<p>the poem. This poem includes the Phaeacian episode,</p>
<p>and the account of</p>
<p>Ulysses‚Äô adventures as told by himself in Books ix.-xii. It consists of</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">lines 1-79 (roughly) of Book i.,</span>
<span class="chapter-marker">of line 28 of Book v.,</span>
<p>and thence</p>
<p>without intermission to the middle of line 187 of Book xiii.,</p>
<p>at which</p>
<p>point the original scheme was abandoned.</p>
<p>(2) The story of Penelope and the suitors,</p>
<p>with the episode of</p>
<p>Telemachus‚Äô voyage to Pylos. This poem begins with line 80 (roughly) of</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">Book i.,</span>
<span class="chapter-marker">is continued to the end of Book iv.,</span>
<p>and not resumed till</p>
<p>Ulysses wakes in the middle of line 187,</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">Book xiii.,</span>
<p>from whence it</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">continues to the end of Book xxiv.</span>
<p>In ‚ÄúThe Authoress of the Odyssey‚Äù,</p>
<p>I wrote:</p>
<p>the introduction of lines xi.,</p>
<p>115-137 and of line ix.,</p>
<p>535,</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>writing a new council of the gods at the beginning of Book v.,</p>
<p>to take</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">the place of the one that was removed to Book i.,</span>
<p>1-79,</p>
<p>were the only</p>
<p>things that were done to give even a semblance of unity to the old</p>
<p>scheme and the new,</p>
<p>and to conceal the fact that the Muse,</p>
<p>after being</p>
<p>asked to sing of one subject,</p>
<p>spend two-thirds of her time in singing a</p>
<p>very different one,</p>
<p>with a climax for which no-one has asked her. For</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">roughly the Return occupies eight Books,</span>
<p>and Penelope and the Suitors</p>
<p>sixteen.</p>
<p>I believe this to be substantially correct.</p>
<p>Lastly,</p>
<p>to deal with a very unimportant point,</p>
<p>I observe that the</p>
<p>Leipsic Teubner edition of 894 makes Books ii. and iii. end with a</p>
<p>comma. Stops are things of such far more recent date than the</p>
<p>‚ÄúOdyssey,</p>
<p>‚Äù that there does not seem much use in adhering to the text in</p>
<p>so small a matter; still,</p>
<p>from a spirit of mere conservatism,</p>
<p>I have</p>
<p>preferred to do so. Why [Greek] at the beginnings of Books ii. and</p>
<p>viii.,</p>
<p>and [Greek],</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">at the beginning of Book vii. should have initial</span>
<p>capitals in an edition far too careful to admit a supposition of</p>
<p>inadvertence,</p>
<p>when [Greek] at the beginning of Books vi. and xiii.,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>[Greek] at the beginning of Book xvii. have no initial capitals,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>cannot determine. No other Books of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù have initial capitals</p>
<p>except the three mentioned unless the first word of the Book is a</p>
<p>proper name.</p>

<p>PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</p>
<p>Butler‚Äôs Translation of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù appeared originally in 1900,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The Authoress of the Odyssey in 1897. In the preface to the new edition</p>
<p>of ‚ÄúThe Authoress‚Äù,</p>
<p>which is published simultaneously with this new</p>
<p>edition of the Translation,</p>
<p>I have given some account of the genesis of</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">the two books.</span>
<p>The size of the original page has been reduced so as to make both books</p>
<p>uniform with Butler‚Äôs other works; and,</p>
<p>fortunately,</p>
<p>it has been</p>
<p>possible,</p>
<p>by using a smaller type,</p>
<p>to get the same number of words into</p>
<p>each page,</p>
<p>so that the references remain good,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>with the exception</p>
<p>of a few minor alterations and rearrangements now to be enumerated so</p>
<p>far as they affect the Translation,</p>
<p>the new editions are faithful</p>
<p>reprints of the original editions,</p>
<p>with misprints and obvious errors</p>
<p>corrected‚Äîno attempt having been made to edit them or to bring them up</p>
<p>to date.</p>
<p>(a) The Index has been revised.</p>
<p>(b) Owing to the reduction in the size of the page it has been</p>
<p>necessary to shorten some of the headlines,</p>
<p>and here advantage has been</p>
<p>taken of various corrections of and additions to the headlines and</p>
<p>shoulder-notes made by Butler in his own copies of the two books.</p>
<p>(c) For the most part each of the illustrations now occupies a page,</p>
<p>whereas in the original editions they generally appeared two on the</p>
<p>page. It has been necessary to reduce the plan of the House of Ulysses.</p>
<p>On page 153 of ‚ÄúThe Authoress‚Äù Butler says: ‚ÄúNo great poet would</p>
<p>compare his hero to a paunch full of blood and fat,</p>
<p>cooking before the</p>
<p>fire (xx,</p>
<p>24-28).‚Äù This passage is not given in the abridged Story of</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù at the beginning of the book,</span>
<p>but in the Translation it</p>
<p>occurs in these words:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus he chided with his heart,</p>
<p>and checked it into endurance,</p>
<p>but he</p>
<p>tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front</p>
<p>of a hot fire,</p>
<p>doing it first on one side then on the other,</p>
<p>that he</p>
<p>may get it cooked as soon as possible; even so did he turn himself</p>
<p>about from side to side,</p>
<p>thinking all the time how,</p>
<p>single-handed as he</p>
<p>was,</p>
<p>he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked</p>
<p>suitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>It looks as though in the interval between the publication of ‚ÄúThe</p>
<p>Authoress‚Äù (1897) and of the Translation (1900) Butler had changed his</p>
<p>mind; for in the first case the comparison is between Ulysses and a</p>
<p>paunch full,</p>
<p>etc.,</p>
<p>and in the second it is between Ulysses and a man</p>
<p>who turns a paunch full,</p>
<p>etc. The second comparison is perhaps one</p>
<p>which a great poet might make.</p>
<p>In seeing the works through the press I have had the invaluable</p>
<p>assistance of Mr. A. T. Bartholomew of the University Library,</p>
<p>Cambridge,</p>
<p>and of Mr. Donald S. Robertson,</p>
<p>Fellow of Trinity College,</p>
<p>Cambridge. To both these friends I give my most cordial thanks for the</p>
<p>care and skill exercised by them. Mr. Robertson has found time for the</p>
<p>labour of checking and correcting all the quotations from and</p>
<p>references to the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù and ‚ÄúOdyssey,</p>
<p>‚Äù and I believe that it could</p>
<p>not have been better performed. It was,</p>
<p>I know,</p>
<p>a pleasure for him; and</p>
<p>it would have been a pleasure also for Butler if he could have known</p>
<p>that his work was being shepherded by the son of his old friend,</p>
<p>Mr. H.</p>
<p>R. Robertson,</p>
<p>who more than half a century ago was a fellow-student</p>
<p>with him at Cary‚Äôs School of Art in Streatham Street,</p>

<p>THE ODYSSEY</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK I</span>
<p>THE GODS IN COUNCIL‚ÄîMINERVA‚ÄôS VISIT TO ITHACA‚ÄîTHE CHALLENGE FROM</p>
<p>TELEMACHUS TO THE SUITORS.</p>
<p>Tell me,</p>
<p>O Muse,</p>
<p>of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide</p>
<p>after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit,</p>
<p>and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was</p>
<p>acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his</p>
<p>own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could</p>
<p>not save his men,</p>
<p>for they perished through their own sheer folly in</p>
<p>eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them</p>
<p>from ever reaching home. Tell me,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>about all these things,</p>
<p>oh</p>
<p>daughter of Jove,</p>
<p>from whatsoever source you may know them.</p>
<p>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely</p>
<p>home except Ulysses,</p>
<p>and he,</p>
<p>though he was longing to return to his</p>
<p>wife and country,</p>
<p>was detained by the goddess Calypso,</p>
<p>who had got him</p>
<p>into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by,</p>
<p>there</p>
<p>came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca;</p>
<p>even then,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>when he was among his own people,</p>
<p>his troubles were</p>
<p>not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him</p>
<p>except Neptune,</p>
<p>who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not</p>
<p>let him get home.</p>
<p>Now Neptune had gone off to the Ethiopians,</p>
<p>who are at the world‚Äôs end,</p>
<p>and lie in two halves,</p>
<p>the one looking West and the other East.1 He had</p>
<p>gone there to accept a hecatomb of sheep and oxen,</p>
<p>and was enjoying</p>
<p>himself at his festival; but the other gods met in the house of</p>
<p>Olympian Jove,</p>
<p>and the sire of gods and men spoke first. At that moment</p>
<p>he was thinking of Aegisthus,</p>
<p>who had been killed by Agamemnon‚Äôs son</p>
<p>Orestes; so he said to the other gods:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSee now,</p>
<p>how men lay blame upon us gods for what is after all nothing</p>
<p>but their own folly. Look at Aegisthus; he must needs make love to</p>
<p>Agamemnon‚Äôs wife unrighteously and then kill Agamemnon,</p>
<p>though he knew</p>
<p>it would be the death of him; for I sent Mercury to warn him not to do</p>
<p>either of these things,</p>
<p>inasmuch as Orestes would be sure to take his</p>
<p>revenge when he grew up and wanted to return home. Mercury told him</p>
<p>this in all good will but he would not listen,</p>
<p>and now he has paid for</p>
<p>everything in full.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>son of Saturn,</p>
<p>King of kings,</p>
<p>it served</p>
<p>Aegisthus right,</p>
<p>and so it would any one else who does as he did; but</p>
<p>Aegisthus is neither here nor there; it is for Ulysses that my heart</p>
<p>bleeds,</p>
<p>when I think of his sufferings in that lonely sea-girt island,</p>
<p>far away,</p>
<p>poor man,</p>
<p>from all his friends. It is an island covered with</p>
<p>forest,</p>
<p>in the very middle of the sea,</p>
<p>and a goddess lives there,</p>
<p>daughter of the magician Atlas,</p>
<p>who looks after the bottom of the</p>
<p>ocean,</p>
<p>and carries the great columns that keep heaven and earth</p>
<p>asunder. This daughter of Atlas has got hold of poor unhappy Ulysses,</p>
<p>and keeps trying by every kind of blandishment to make him forget his</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>so that he is tired of life,</p>
<p>and thinks of nothing but how he may</p>
<p>once more see the smoke of his own chimneys. You,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>take no heed of</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>and yet when Ulysses was before Troy did he not propitiate you</p>
<p>with many a burnt sacrifice? Why then should you keep on being so angry</p>
<p>with him?‚Äù</p>
<p>And Jove said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy child,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? How can I forget</p>
<p>Ulysses than whom there is no more capable man on earth,</p>
<p>nor more</p>
<p>liberal in his offerings to the immortal gods that live in heaven? Bear</p>
<p>in mind,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that Neptune is still furious with Ulysses for having</p>
<p>blinded an eye of Polyphemus king of the Cyclopes. Polyphemus is son to</p>
<p>Neptune by the nymph Thoosa,</p>
<p>daughter to the sea-king Phorcys;</p>
<p>therefore though he will not kill Ulysses outright,</p>
<p>he torments him by</p>
<p>preventing him from getting home. Still,</p>
<p>let us lay our heads together</p>
<p>and see how we can help him to return; Neptune will then be pacified,</p>
<p>for if we are all of a mind he can hardly stand out against us.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>son of Saturn,</p>
<p>King of kings,</p>
<p>if,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>gods now mean that Ulysses should get home,</p>
<p>we should first send</p>
<p>Mercury to the Ogygian island to tell Calypso that we have made up our</p>
<p>minds and that he is to return. In the meantime I will go to Ithaca,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>put heart into Ulysses‚Äô son Telemachus; I will embolden him to call the</p>
<p>Achaeans in assembly,</p>
<p>and speak out to the suitors of his mother</p>
<p>Penelope,</p>
<p>who persist in eating up any number of his sheep and oxen; I</p>
<p>will also conduct him to Sparta and to Pylos,</p>
<p>to see if he can hear</p>
<p>anything about the return of his dear father‚Äîfor this will make people</p>
<p>speak well of him.‚Äù</p>
<p>So saying she bound on her glittering golden sandals,</p>
<p>imperishable,</p>
<p>with which she can fly like the wind over land or sea; she grasped the</p>
<p>redoubtable bronze-shod spear,</p>
<p>so stout and sturdy and strong,</p>
<p>wherewith she quells the ranks of heroes who have displeased her,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>down she darted from the topmost summits of Olympus,</p>
<p>whereon forthwith</p>
<p>she was in Ithaca,</p>
<p>at the gateway of Ulysses‚Äô house,</p>
<p>disguised as a</p>
<p>visitor,</p>
<p>Mentes,</p>
<p>chief of the Taphians,</p>
<p>and she held a bronze spear in</p>
<p>her hand. There she found the lordly suitors seated on hides of the</p>
<p>oxen which they had killed and eaten,</p>
<p>and playing draughts in front of</p>
<p>the house. Men-servants and pages were bustling about to wait upon</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>some mixing wine with water in the mixing-bowls,</p>
<p>some cleaning</p>
<p>down the tables with wet sponges and laying them out again,</p>
<p>and some</p>
<p>cutting up great quantities of meat.</p>
<p>Telemachus saw her long before any one else did. He was sitting moodily</p>
<p>among the suitors thinking about his brave father,</p>
<p>and how he would</p>
<p>send them flying out of the house,</p>
<p>if he were to come to his own again</p>
<p>and be honoured as in days gone by. Thus brooding as he sat among them,</p>
<p>he caught sight of Minerva and went straight to the gate,</p>
<p>for he was</p>
<p>vexed that a stranger should be kept waiting for admittance. He took</p>
<p>her right hand in his own,</p>
<p>and bade her give him her spear. ‚ÄúWelcome,</p>
<p>‚Äù</p>
<p>said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúto our house,</p>
<p>and when you have partaken of food you shall</p>
<p>tell us what you have come for.‚Äù</p>
<p>He led the way as he spoke,</p>
<p>and Minerva followed him. When they were</p>
<p>within he took her spear and set it in the spear-stand against a strong</p>
<p>bearing-post along with the many other spears of his unhappy father,</p>
<p>and he conducted her to a richly decorated seat under which he threw a</p>
<p>cloth of damask. There was a footstool also for her feet,</p>
<p>2 and he set</p>
<p>another seat near her for himself,</p>
<p>away from the suitors,</p>
<p>that she</p>
<p>might not be annoyed while eating by their noise and insolence,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that he might ask her more freely about his father.</p>
<p>A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden ewer and</p>
<p>poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands,</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them bread,</p>
<p>and offered them many good things of what there was in the house,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and set cups of gold</p>
<p>by their side,</p>
<p>and a manservant brought them wine and poured it out for</p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>Then the suitors came in and took their places on the benches and</p>
<p>seats.3 Forthwith men servants poured water over their hands,</p>
<p>maids</p>
<p>went round with the bread-baskets,</p>
<p>pages filled the mixing-bowls with</p>
<p>wine and water,</p>
<p>and they laid their hands upon the good things that</p>
<p>were before them. As soon as they had had enough to eat and drink they</p>
<p>wanted music and dancing,</p>
<p>which are the crowning embellishments of a</p>
<p>banquet,</p>
<p>so a servant brought a lyre to Phemius,</p>
<p>whom they compelled</p>
<p>perforce to sing to them. As soon as he touched his lyre and began to</p>
<p>sing Telemachus spoke low to Minerva,</p>
<p>with his head close to hers that</p>
<p>no man might hear.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat you will not be offended with what I am</p>
<p>going to say. Singing comes cheap to those who do not pay for it,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>all this is done at the cost of one whose bones lie rotting in some</p>
<p>wilderness or grinding to powder in the surf. If these men were to see</p>
<p>my father come back to Ithaca they would pray for longer legs rather</p>
<p>than a longer purse,</p>
<p>for money would not serve them; but he,</p>
<p>alas,</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>fallen on an ill fate,</p>
<p>and even when people do sometimes say that he is</p>
<p>coming,</p>
<p>we no longer heed them; we shall never see him again. And now,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>tell me and tell me true,</p>
<p>who you are and where you come from.</p>
<p>Tell me of your town and parents,</p>
<p>what manner of ship you came in,</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>your crew brought you to Ithaca,</p>
<p>and of what nation they declared</p>
<p>themselves to be‚Äîfor you cannot have come by land. Tell me also truly,</p>
<p>for I want to know,</p>
<p>are you a stranger to this house,</p>
<p>or have you been</p>
<p>here in my father‚Äôs time? In the old days we had many visitors for my</p>
<p>father went about much himself.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Minerva answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you truly and particularly all about</p>
<p>it. I am Mentes,</p>
<p>son of Anchialus,</p>
<p>and I am King of the Taphians. I</p>
<p>have come here with my ship and crew,</p>
<p>on a voyage to men of a foreign</p>
<p>tongue being bound for Temesa4 with a cargo of iron,</p>
<p>and I shall bring</p>
<p>back copper. As for my ship,</p>
<p>it lies over yonder off the open country</p>
<p>away from the town,</p>
<p>in the harbour Rheithron5 under the wooded mountain</p>
<p>Neritum.6 Our fathers were friends before us,</p>
<p>as old Laertes will tell</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>if you will go and ask him. They say,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that he never comes</p>
<p>to town now,</p>
<p>and lives by himself in the country,</p>
<p>faring hardly,</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>an old woman to look after him and get his dinner for him,</p>
<p>when he</p>
<p>comes in tired from pottering about his vineyard. They told me your</p>
<p>father was at home again,</p>
<p>and that was why I came,</p>
<p>but it seems the</p>
<p>gods are still keeping him back,</p>
<p>for he is not dead yet not on the</p>
<p>mainland. It is more likely he is on some sea-girt island in mid ocean,</p>
<p>or a prisoner among savages who are detaining him against his will. I</p>
<p>am no prophet,</p>
<p>and know very little about omens,</p>
<p>but I speak as it is</p>
<p>borne in upon me from heaven,</p>
<p>and assure you that he will not be away</p>
<p>much longer; for he is a man of such resource that even though he were</p>
<p>in chains of iron he would find some means of getting home again. But</p>
<p>tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>can Ulysses really have such a fine looking</p>
<p>fellow for a son? You are indeed wonderfully like him about the head</p>
<p>and eyes,</p>
<p>for we were close friends before he set sail for Troy where</p>
<p>the flower of all the Argives went also. Since that time we have never</p>
<p>either of us seen the other.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äútells me I am son to Ulysses,</p>
<p>but it</p>
<p>is a wise child that knows his own father. Would that I were son to one</p>
<p>who had grown old upon his own estates,</p>
<p>for,</p>
<p>since you ask me,</p>
<p>there is</p>
<p>no more ill-starred man under heaven than he who they tell me is my</p>
<p>father.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere is no fear of your race dying out yet,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>Penelope has such a fine son as you are. But tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>what is the meaning of all this feasting,</p>
<p>and who are these people?</p>
<p>What is it all about? Have you some banquet,</p>
<p>or is there a wedding in</p>
<p>the family‚Äîfor no one seems to be bringing any provisions of his own?</p>
<p>And the guests‚Äîhow atrociously they are behaving; what riot they make</p>
<p>over the whole house; it is enough to disgust any respectable person</p>
<p>who comes near them.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúas regards your question,</p>
<p>so long as my father</p>
<p>was here it was well with us and with the house,</p>
<p>but the gods in their</p>
<p>displeasure have willed it otherwise,</p>
<p>and have hidden him away more</p>
<p>closely than mortal man was ever yet hidden. I could have borne it</p>
<p>better even though he were dead,</p>
<p>if he had fallen with his men before</p>
<p>Troy,</p>
<p>or had died with friends around him when the days of his fighting</p>
<p>were done; for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his</p>
<p>ashes,</p>
<p>and I should myself have been heir to his renown; but now the</p>
<p>storm-winds have spirited him away we know not whither; he is gone</p>
<p>without leaving so much as a trace behind him,</p>
<p>and I inherit nothing</p>
<p>but dismay. Nor does the matter end simply with grief for the loss of</p>
<p>my father; heaven has laid sorrows upon me of yet another kind; for the</p>
<p>chiefs from all our islands,</p>
<p>Dulichium,</p>
<p>Same,</p>
<p>and the woodland island</p>
<p>of Zacynthus,</p>
<p>as also all the principal men of Ithaca itself,</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>eating up my house under the pretext of paying their court to my</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>who will neither point blank say that she will not marry,</p>
<p>7 nor</p>
<p>yet bring matters to an end; so they are making havoc of my estate,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>before long will do so also with myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIs that so?‚Äù exclaimed Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúthen you do indeed want Ulysses home</p>
<p>again. Give him his helmet,</p>
<p>shield,</p>
<p>and a couple of lances,</p>
<p>and if he</p>
<p>is the man he was when I first knew him in our house,</p>
<p>drinking and</p>
<p>making merry,</p>
<p>he would soon lay his hands about these rascally suitors,</p>
<p>were he to stand once more upon his own threshold. He was then coming</p>
<p>from Ephyra,</p>
<p>where he had been to beg poison for his arrows from Ilus,</p>
<p>son of Mermerus. Ilus feared the ever-living gods and would not give</p>
<p>him any,</p>
<p>but my father let him have some,</p>
<p>for he was very fond of him.</p>
<p>If Ulysses is the man he then was these suitors will have a short</p>
<p>shrift and a sorry wedding.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut there! It rests with heaven to determine whether he is to return,</p>
<p>and take his revenge in his own house or no; I would,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>urge you</p>
<p>to set about trying to get rid of these suitors at once. Take my</p>
<p>advice,</p>
<p>call the Achaean heroes in assembly to-morrow morning‚Äîlay your</p>
<p>case before them,</p>
<p>and call heaven to bear you witness. Bid the suitors</p>
<p>take themselves off,</p>
<p>each to his own place,</p>
<p>and if your mother‚Äôs mind</p>
<p>is set on marrying again,</p>
<p>let her go back to her father,</p>
<p>who will find</p>
<p>her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts that so dear</p>
<p>a daughter may expect. As for yourself,</p>
<p>let me prevail upon you to take</p>
<p>the best ship you can get,</p>
<p>with a crew of twenty men,</p>
<p>and go in quest</p>
<p>of your father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell you</p>
<p>something,</p>
<p>or (and people often hear things in this way) some</p>
<p>heaven-sent message may direct you. First go to Pylos and ask Nestor;</p>
<p>thence go on to Sparta and visit Menelaus,</p>
<p>for he got home last of all</p>
<p>the Achaeans; if you hear that your father is alive and on his way</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>you can put up with the waste these suitors will make for yet</p>
<p>another twelve months. If on the other hand you hear of his death,</p>
<p>come</p>
<p>home at once,</p>
<p>celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,</p>
<p>build a</p>
<p>barrow to his memory,</p>
<p>and make your mother marry again. Then,</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>done all this,</p>
<p>think it well over in your mind how,</p>
<p>by fair means or</p>
<p>foul,</p>
<p>you may kill these suitors in your own house. You are too old to</p>
<p>plead infancy any longer; have you not heard how people are singing</p>
<p>Orestes‚Äô praises for having killed his father‚Äôs murderer Aegisthus? You</p>
<p>are a fine,</p>
<p>smart looking fellow; show your mettle,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>and make</p>
<p>yourself a name in story. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I must go back to my ship and</p>
<p>to my crew,</p>
<p>who will be impatient if I keep them waiting longer; think</p>
<p>the matter over for yourself,</p>
<p>and remember what I have said to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúit has been very kind of you to talk to me</p>
<p>in this way,</p>
<p>as though I were your own son,</p>
<p>and I will do all you tell</p>
<p>me; I know you want to be getting on with your voyage,</p>
<p>but stay a</p>
<p>little longer till you have taken a bath and refreshed yourself. I will</p>
<p>then give you a present,</p>
<p>and you shall go on your way rejoicing; I will</p>
<p>give you one of great beauty and value‚Äîa keepsake such as only dear</p>
<p>friends give to one another.‚Äù</p>
<p>Minerva answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not try to keep me,</p>
<p>for I would be on my way at</p>
<p>once. As for any present you may be disposed to make me,</p>
<p>keep it till I</p>
<p>come again,</p>
<p>and I will take it home with me. You shall give me a very</p>
<p>good one,</p>
<p>and I will give you one of no less value in return.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words she flew away like a bird into the air,</p>
<p>but she had</p>
<p>given Telemachus courage,</p>
<p>and had made him think more than ever about</p>
<p>his father. He felt the change,</p>
<p>wondered at it,</p>
<p>and knew that the</p>
<p>stranger had been a god,</p>
<p>so he went straight to where the suitors were</p>
<p>sitting.</p>
<p>Phemius was still singing,</p>
<p>and his hearers sat rapt in silence as he</p>
<p>told the sad tale of the return from Troy,</p>
<p>and the ills Minerva had</p>
<p>laid upon the Achaeans. Penelope,</p>
<p>daughter of Icarius,</p>
<p>heard his song</p>
<p>from her room upstairs,</p>
<p>and came down by the great staircase,</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>alone,</p>
<p>but attended by two of her handmaids. When she reached the</p>
<p>suitors she stood by one of the bearing posts that supported the roof</p>
<p>of the cloisters8 with a staid maiden on either side of her. She held a</p>
<p>veil,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>before her face,</p>
<p>and was weeping bitterly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPhemius,</p>
<p>‚Äù she cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou know many another feat of gods and heroes,</p>
<p>such as poets love to celebrate. Sing the suitors some one of these,</p>
<p>and let them drink their wine in silence,</p>
<p>but cease this sad tale,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>it breaks my sorrowful heart,</p>
<p>and reminds me of my lost husband whom I</p>
<p>mourn ever without ceasing,</p>
<p>and whose name was great over all Hellas</p>
<p>and middle Argos.‚Äù9</p>
<p>‚ÄúMother,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúlet the bard sing what he has a mind</p>
<p>to; bards do not make the ills they sing of; it is Jove,</p>
<p>not they,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>makes them,</p>
<p>and who sends weal or woe upon mankind according to his own</p>
<p>good pleasure. This fellow means no harm by singing the ill-fated</p>
<p>return of the Danaans,</p>
<p>for people always applaud the latest songs most</p>
<p>warmly. Make up your mind to it and bear it; Ulysses is not the only</p>
<p>man who never came back from Troy,</p>
<p>but many another went down as well</p>
<p>as he. Go,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>within the house and busy yourself with your daily</p>
<p>duties,</p>
<p>your loom,</p>
<p>your distaff,</p>
<p>and the ordering of your servants; for</p>
<p>speech is man‚Äôs matter,</p>
<p>and mine above all others 10‚Äîfor it is I who am</p>
<p>master here.‚Äù</p>
<p>She went wondering back into the house,</p>
<p>and laid her son‚Äôs saying in</p>
<p>her heart. Then,</p>
<p>going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,</p>
<p>she</p>
<p>mourned her dear husband till Minerva shed sweet sleep over her eyes.</p>
<p>But the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloisters11,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>prayed each one that he might be her bed fellow.</p>
<p>Then Telemachus spoke,</p>
<p>‚ÄúShameless,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúand insolent suitors,</p>
<p>let us feast at our pleasure now,</p>
<p>and let there be no brawling,</p>
<p>for it</p>
<p>is a rare thing to hear a man with such a divine voice as Phemius has;</p>
<p>but in the morning meet me in full assembly that I may give you formal</p>
<p>notice to depart,</p>
<p>and feast at one another‚Äôs houses,</p>
<p>turn and turn</p>
<p>about,</p>
<p>at your own cost. If on the other hand you choose to persist in</p>
<p>spunging upon one man,</p>
<p>heaven help me,</p>
<p>but Jove shall reckon with you</p>
<p>in full,</p>
<p>and when you fall in my father‚Äôs house there shall be no man</p>
<p>to avenge you.‚Äù</p>
<p>The suitors bit their lips as they heard him,</p>
<p>and marvelled at the</p>
<p>boldness of his speech. Then,</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>son of Eupeithes,</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe</p>
<p>gods seem to have given you lessons in bluster and tall talking; may</p>
<p>Jove never grant you to be chief in Ithaca as your father was before</p>
<p>you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>do not chide with me,</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>god willing,</p>
<p>I will be chief too if I can. Is this the worst fate you can think of</p>
<p>for me? It is no bad thing to be a chief,</p>
<p>for it brings both riches and</p>
<p>honour. Still,</p>
<p>now that Ulysses is dead there are many great men in</p>
<p>Ithaca both old and young,</p>
<p>and some other may take the lead among them;</p>
<p>nevertheless I will be chief in my own house,</p>
<p>and will rule those whom</p>
<p>Ulysses has won for me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Eurymachus,</p>
<p>son of Polybus,</p>
<p>answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt rests with heaven to</p>
<p>decide who shall be chief among us,</p>
<p>but you shall be master in your own</p>
<p>house and over your own possessions; no one while there is a man in</p>
<p>Ithaca shall do you violence nor rob you. And now,</p>
<p>my good fellow,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>want to know about this stranger. What country does he come from? Of</p>
<p>what family is he,</p>
<p>and where is his estate? Has he brought you news</p>
<p>about the return of your father,</p>
<p>or was he on business of his own? He</p>
<p>seemed a well to do man,</p>
<p>but he hurried off so suddenly that he was</p>
<p>gone in a moment before we could get to know him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy father is dead and gone,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúand even if some</p>
<p>rumour reaches me I put no more faith in it now. My mother does indeed</p>
<p>sometimes send for a soothsayer and question him,</p>
<p>but I give his</p>
<p>prophecyings no heed. As for the stranger,</p>
<p>he was Mentes,</p>
<p>son of</p>
<p>Anchialus,</p>
<p>chief of the Taphians,</p>
<p>an old friend of my father‚Äôs.‚Äù But in</p>
<p>his heart he knew that it had been the goddess.</p>
<p>The suitors then returned to their singing and dancing until the</p>
<p>evening; but when night fell upon their pleasuring they went home to</p>
<p>bed each in his own abode.12 Telemachus‚Äôs room was high up in a tower13</p>
<p>that looked on to the outer court; hither,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>he hied,</p>
<p>brooding and</p>
<p>full of thought. A good old woman,</p>
<p>Euryclea,</p>
<p>daughter of Ops,</p>
<p>the son</p>
<p>of Pisenor,</p>
<p>went before him with a couple of blazing torches. Laertes</p>
<p>had bought her with his own money when she was quite young; he gave the</p>
<p>worth of twenty oxen for her,</p>
<p>and shewed as much respect to her in his</p>
<p>household as he did to his own wedded wife,</p>
<p>but he did not take her to</p>
<p>his bed for he feared his wife‚Äôs resentment.14 She it was who now</p>
<p>lighted Telemachus to his room,</p>
<p>and she loved him better than any of</p>
<p>the other women in the house did,</p>
<p>for she had nursed him when he was a</p>
<p>baby. He opened the door of his bed room and sat down upon the bed; as</p>
<p>he took off his shirt15 he gave it to the good old woman,</p>
<p>who folded it</p>
<p>tidily up,</p>
<p>and hung it for him over a peg by his bed side,</p>
<p>after which</p>
<p>she went out,</p>
<p>pulled the door to by a silver catch,</p>
<p>and drew the bolt</p>
<p>home by means of the strap.16 But Telemachus as he lay covered with a</p>
<p>woollen fleece kept thinking all night through of his intended voyage</p>
<p>and of the counsel that Minerva had given him.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK II</span>
<p>ASSEMBLY OF THE PEOPLE OF ITHACA‚ÄîSPEECHES OF TELEMACHUS AND OF THE</p>
<p>SUITORS‚ÄîTELEMACHUS MAKES HIS PREPARATIONS AND STARTS FOR PYLOS WITH</p>
<p>MINERVA DISGUISED AS MENTOR.</p>
<p>Now when the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared Telemachus</p>
<p>rose and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,</p>
<p>girded his sword about his shoulder,</p>
<p>and left his room looking like an</p>
<p>immortal god. He at once sent the criers round to call the people in</p>
<p>assembly,</p>
<p>so they called them and the people gathered thereon; then,</p>
<p>when they were got together,</p>
<p>he went to the place of assembly spear in</p>
<p>hand‚Äînot alone,</p>
<p>for his two hounds went with him. Minerva endowed him</p>
<p>with a presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as</p>
<p>he went by,</p>
<p>and when he took his place in his father‚Äôs seat even the</p>
<p>oldest councillors made way for him.</p>
<p>Aegyptius,</p>
<p>a man bent double with age,</p>
<p>and of infinite experience,</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>the first to speak. His son Antiphus had gone with Ulysses to Ilius,</p>
<p>land of noble steeds,</p>
<p>but the savage Cyclops had killed him when they</p>
<p>were all shut up in the cave,</p>
<p>and had cooked his last dinner for him.17</p>
<p>He had three sons left,</p>
<p>of whom two still worked on their father‚Äôs</p>
<p>land,</p>
<p>while the third,</p>
<p>Eurynomus,</p>
<p>was one of the suitors; nevertheless</p>
<p>their father could not get over the loss of Antiphus,</p>
<p>and was still</p>
<p>weeping for him when he began his speech.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMen of Ithaca,</p>
<p>‚Äù he said,</p>
<p>‚Äúhear my words. From the day Ulysses left us</p>
<p>there has been no meeting of our councillors until now; who then can it</p>
<p>be,</p>
<p>whether old or young,</p>
<p>that finds it so necessary to convene us? Has</p>
<p>he got wind of some host approaching,</p>
<p>and does he wish to warn us,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>would he speak upon some other matter of public moment? I am sure he is</p>
<p>an excellent person,</p>
<p>and I hope Jove will grant him his heart‚Äôs</p>
<p>desire.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once,</p>
<p>for he</p>
<p>was bursting with what he had to say. He stood in the middle of the</p>
<p>assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,</p>
<p>turning to Aegyptius,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúit is I,</p>
<p>as you will shortly</p>
<p>learn,</p>
<p>who have convened you,</p>
<p>for it is I who am the most aggrieved. I</p>
<p>have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn you,</p>
<p>nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak. My</p>
<p>grievance is purely personal,</p>
<p>and turns on two great misfortunes which</p>
<p>have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of my</p>
<p>excellent father,</p>
<p>who was chief among all you here present,</p>
<p>and was</p>
<p>like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all the chief</p>
<p>men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against her will.</p>
<p>They are afraid to go to her father Icarius,</p>
<p>asking him to choose the</p>
<p>one he likes best,</p>
<p>and to provide marriage gifts for his daughter,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>day by day they keep hanging about my father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>sacrificing our</p>
<p>oxen,</p>
<p>sheep,</p>
<p>and fat goats for their banquets,</p>
<p>and never giving so much</p>
<p>as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand</p>
<p>such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our</p>
<p>doors,</p>
<p>and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days</p>
<p>be as good a man as he was,</p>
<p>still I would indeed defend myself if I had</p>
<p>power to do so,</p>
<p>for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house</p>
<p>is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>to your own</p>
<p>consciences and to public opinion. Fear,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>the wrath of heaven,</p>
<p>lest</p>
<p>the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and</p>
<p>Themis,</p>
<p>who is the beginning and the end of councils,</p>
<p>[do not] hold</p>
<p>back,</p>
<p>my friends,</p>
<p>and leave me singlehanded18‚Äîunless it be that my</p>
<p>brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now</p>
<p>avenge on me,</p>
<p>by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover,</p>
<p>if I am</p>
<p>to be eaten out of house and home at all,</p>
<p>I had rather you did the</p>
<p>eating yourselves,</p>
<p>for I could then take action against you to some</p>
<p>purpose,</p>
<p>and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid</p>
<p>in full,</p>
<p>whereas now I have no remedy.‚Äù19</p>
<p>With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into</p>
<p>tears. Every one was very sorry for him,</p>
<p>but they all sat still and no</p>
<p>one ventured to make him an angry answer,</p>
<p>save only Antinous,</p>
<p>who spoke</p>
<p>thus:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>insolent braggart that you are,</p>
<p>how dare you try to throw</p>
<p>the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother‚Äôs fault not ours,</p>
<p>for she</p>
<p>is a very artful woman. This three years past,</p>
<p>and close on four,</p>
<p>she</p>
<p>had been driving us out of our minds,</p>
<p>by encouraging each one of us,</p>
<p>and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And</p>
<p>then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great</p>
<p>tambour frame in her room,</p>
<p>and began to work on an enormous piece of</p>
<p>fine needlework. ‚ÄòSweet hearts,</p>
<p>‚Äô said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses is indeed dead,</p>
<p>still do not press me to marry again immediately,</p>
<p>wait‚Äîfor I would not</p>
<p>have skill in needlework perish unrecorded‚Äîtill I have completed a pall</p>
<p>for the hero Laertes,</p>
<p>to be in readiness against the time when death</p>
<p>shall take him. He is very rich,</p>
<p>and the women of the place will talk</p>
<p>if he is laid out without a pall.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis was what she said,</p>
<p>and we assented; whereon we could see her</p>
<p>working on her great web all day long,</p>
<p>but at night she would unpick</p>
<p>the stitches again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three</p>
<p>years and we never found her out,</p>
<p>but as time wore on and she was now</p>
<p>in her fourth year,</p>
<p>one of her maids who knew what she was doing told</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>and we caught her in the act of undoing her work,</p>
<p>so she had to</p>
<p>finish it whether she would or no. The suitors,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>make you</p>
<p>this answer,</p>
<p>that both you and the Achaeans may understand‚Äî‚ÄòSend your</p>
<p>mother away,</p>
<p>and bid her marry the man of her own and of her father‚Äôs</p>
<p>choice‚Äô; for I do not know what will happen if she goes on plaguing us</p>
<p>much longer with the airs she gives herself on the score of the</p>
<p>accomplishments Minerva has taught her,</p>
<p>and because she is so clever.</p>
<p>We never yet heard of such a woman; we know all about Tyro,</p>
<p>Alcmena,</p>
<p>Mycene,</p>
<p>and the famous women of old,</p>
<p>but they were nothing to your</p>
<p>mother any one of them. It was not fair of her to treat us in that way,</p>
<p>and as long as she continues in the mind with which heaven has now</p>
<p>endowed her,</p>
<p>so long shall we go on eating up your estate; and I do not</p>
<p>see why she should change,</p>
<p>for she gets all the honour and glory,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it is you who pay for it,</p>
<p>not she. Understand,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>that we will not</p>
<p>go back to our lands,</p>
<p>neither here nor elsewhere,</p>
<p>till she has made her</p>
<p>choice and married some one or other of us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>how can I drive the mother who bore me</p>
<p>from my father‚Äôs house? My father is abroad and we do not know whether</p>
<p>he is alive or dead. It will be hard on me if I have to pay Icarius the</p>
<p>large sum which I must give him if I insist on sending his daughter</p>
<p>back to him. Not only will he deal rigorously with me,</p>
<p>but heaven will</p>
<p>also punish me; for my mother when she leaves the house will call on</p>
<p>the Erinyes to avenge her; besides,</p>
<p>it would not be a creditable thing</p>
<p>to do,</p>
<p>and I will have nothing to say to it. If you choose to take</p>
<p>offence at this,</p>
<p>leave the house and feast elsewhere at one another‚Äôs</p>
<p>houses at your own cost turn and turn about. If,</p>
<p>on the other hand,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>elect to persist in spunging upon one man,</p>
<p>heaven help me,</p>
<p>but Jove</p>
<p>shall reckon with you in full,</p>
<p>and when you fall in my father‚Äôs house</p>
<p>there shall be no man to avenge you.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke Jove sent two eagles from the top of the mountain,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>flew on and on with the wind,</p>
<p>sailing side by side in their own lordly</p>
<p>flight. When they were right over the middle of the assembly they</p>
<p>wheeled and circled about,</p>
<p>beating the air with their wings and glaring</p>
<p>death into the eyes of them that were below; then,</p>
<p>fighting fiercely</p>
<p>and tearing at one another,</p>
<p>they flew off towards the right over the</p>
<p>town. The people wondered as they saw them,</p>
<p>and asked each other what</p>
<p>all this might be; whereon Halitherses,</p>
<p>who was the best prophet and</p>
<p>reader of omens among them,</p>
<p>spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>men of Ithaca,</p>
<p>and I speak more particularly to the suitors,</p>
<p>for I see mischief brewing for them. Ulysses is not going to be away</p>
<p>much longer; indeed he is close at hand to deal out death and</p>
<p>destruction,</p>
<p>not on them alone,</p>
<p>but on many another of us who live in</p>
<p>Ithaca. Let us then be wise in time,</p>
<p>and put a stop to this wickedness</p>
<p>before he comes. Let the suitors do so of their own accord; it will be</p>
<p>better for them,</p>
<p>for I am not prophesying without due knowledge;</p>
<p>everything has happened to Ulysses as I foretold when the Argives set</p>
<p>out for Troy,</p>
<p>and he with them. I said that after going through much</p>
<p>hardship and losing all his men he should come home again in the</p>
<p>twentieth year and that no one would know him; and now all this is</p>
<p>coming true.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eurymachus son of Polybus then said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo home,</p>
<p>old man,</p>
<p>and prophesy to</p>
<p>your own children,</p>
<p>or it may be worse for them. I can read these omens</p>
<p>myself much better than you can; birds are always flying about in the</p>
<p>sunshine somewhere or other,</p>
<p>but they seldom mean anything. Ulysses has</p>
<p>died in a far country,</p>
<p>and it is a pity you are not dead along with</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>instead of prating here about omens and adding fuel to the anger</p>
<p>of Telemachus which is fierce enough as it is. I suppose you think he</p>
<p>will give you something for your family,</p>
<p>but I tell you‚Äîand it shall</p>
<p>surely be‚Äîwhen an old man like you,</p>
<p>who should know better,</p>
<p>talks a</p>
<p>young one over till he becomes troublesome,</p>
<p>in the first place his</p>
<p>young friend will only fare so much the worse‚Äîhe will take nothing by</p>
<p>it,</p>
<p>for the suitors will prevent this‚Äîand in the next,</p>
<p>we will lay a</p>
<p>heavier fine,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>upon yourself than you will at all like paying,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>it will bear hardly upon you. As for Telemachus,</p>
<p>I warn him in the</p>
<p>presence of you all to send his mother back to her father,</p>
<p>who will</p>
<p>find her a husband and provide her with all the marriage gifts so dear</p>
<p>a daughter may expect. Till then we shall go on harassing him with our</p>
<p>suit; for we fear no man,</p>
<p>and care neither for him,</p>
<p>with all his fine</p>
<p>speeches,</p>
<p>nor for any fortune-telling of yours. You may preach as much</p>
<p>as you please,</p>
<p>but we shall only hate you the more. We shall go back</p>
<p>and continue to eat up Telemachus‚Äôs estate without paying him,</p>
<p>till</p>
<p>such time as his mother leaves off tormenting us by keeping us day</p>
<p>after day on the tiptoe of expectation,</p>
<p>each vying with the other in</p>
<p>his suit for a prize of such rare perfection. Besides we cannot go</p>
<p>after the other women whom we should marry in due course,</p>
<p>but for the</p>
<p>way in which she treats us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurymachus,</p>
<p>and you other suitors,</p>
<p>I shall say</p>
<p>no more,</p>
<p>and entreat you no further,</p>
<p>for the gods and the people of</p>
<p>Ithaca now know my story. Give me,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>a ship and a crew of twenty</p>
<p>men to take me hither and thither,</p>
<p>and I will go to Sparta and to Pylos</p>
<p>in quest of my father who has so long been missing. Some one may tell</p>
<p>me something,</p>
<p>or (and people often hear things in this way) some</p>
<p>heaven-sent message may direct me. If I can hear of him as alive and on</p>
<p>his way home I will put up with the waste you suitors will make for yet</p>
<p>another twelve months. If on the other hand I hear of his death,</p>
<p>I will</p>
<p>return at once,</p>
<p>celebrate his funeral rites with all due pomp,</p>
<p>build a</p>
<p>barrow to his memory,</p>
<p>and make my mother marry again.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he sat down,</p>
<p>and Mentor20 who had been a friend of</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>and had been left in charge of everything with full authority</p>
<p>over the servants,</p>
<p>rose to speak. He,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>plainly and in all honesty</p>
<p>addressed them thus:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>men of Ithaca,</p>
<p>I hope that you may never have a kind and</p>
<p>well-disposed ruler any more,</p>
<p>nor one who will govern you equitably; I</p>
<p>hope that all your chiefs henceforward may be cruel and unjust,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>there is not one of you but has forgotten Ulysses,</p>
<p>who ruled you as</p>
<p>though he were your father. I am not half so angry with the suitors,</p>
<p>for if they choose to do violence in the naughtiness of their hearts,</p>
<p>and wager their heads that Ulysses will not return,</p>
<p>they can take the</p>
<p>high hand and eat up his estate,</p>
<p>but as for you others I am shocked at</p>
<p>the way in which you all sit still without even trying to stop such</p>
<p>scandalous goings on‚Äîwhich you could do if you chose,</p>
<p>for you are many</p>
<p>and they are few.‚Äù</p>
<p>Leiocritus,</p>
<p>son of Evenor,</p>
<p>answered him saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMentor,</p>
<p>what folly is</p>
<p>all this,</p>
<p>that you should set the people to stay us? It is a hard thing</p>
<p>for one man to fight with many about his victuals. Even though Ulysses</p>
<p>himself were to set upon us while we are feasting in his house,</p>
<p>and do</p>
<p>his best to oust us,</p>
<p>his wife,</p>
<p>who wants him back so very badly,</p>
<p>would</p>
<p>have small cause for rejoicing,</p>
<p>and his blood would be upon his own</p>
<p>head if he fought against such great odds. There is no sense in what</p>
<p>you have been saying. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>do you people go about your</p>
<p>business,</p>
<p>and let his father‚Äôs old friends,</p>
<p>Mentor and Halitherses,</p>
<p>speed this boy on his journey,</p>
<p>if he goes at all‚Äîwhich I do not think</p>
<p>he will,</p>
<p>for he is more likely to stay where he is till some one comes</p>
<p>and tells him something.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he broke up the assembly,</p>
<p>and every man went back to his own</p>
<p>abode,</p>
<p>while the suitors returned to the house of Ulysses.</p>
<p>Then Telemachus went all alone by the sea side,</p>
<p>washed his hands in the</p>
<p>grey waves,</p>
<p>and prayed to Minerva.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou god who visited me yesterday,</p>
<p>and bade me</p>
<p>sail the seas in search of my father who has so long been missing. I</p>
<p>would obey you,</p>
<p>but the Achaeans,</p>
<p>and more particularly the wicked</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>are hindering me that I cannot do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he thus prayed,</p>
<p>Minerva came close up to him in the likeness and</p>
<p>with the voice of Mentor. ‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúif you are made of</p>
<p>the same stuff as your father you will be neither fool nor coward</p>
<p>henceforward,</p>
<p>for Ulysses never broke his word nor left his work half</p>
<p>done. If,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>you take after him,</p>
<p>your voyage will not be fruitless,</p>
<p>but unless you have the blood of Ulysses and of Penelope in your veins</p>
<p>I see no likelihood of your succeeding. Sons are seldom as good men as</p>
<p>their fathers; they are generally worse,</p>
<p>not better; still,</p>
<p>as you are</p>
<p>not going to be either fool or coward henceforward,</p>
<p>and are not</p>
<p>entirely without some share of your father‚Äôs wise discernment,</p>
<p>I look</p>
<p>with hope upon your undertaking. But mind you never make common cause</p>
<p>with any of those foolish suitors,</p>
<p>for they have neither sense nor</p>
<p>virtue,</p>
<p>and give no thought to death and to the doom that will shortly</p>
<p>fall on one and all of them,</p>
<p>so that they shall perish on the same day.</p>
<p>As for your voyage,</p>
<p>it shall not be long delayed; your father was such</p>
<p>an old friend of mine that I will find you a ship,</p>
<p>and will come with</p>
<p>you myself. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>return home,</p>
<p>and go about among the suitors;</p>
<p>begin getting provisions ready for your voyage; see everything well</p>
<p>stowed,</p>
<p>the wine in jars,</p>
<p>and the barley meal,</p>
<p>which is the staff of</p>
<p>life,</p>
<p>in leathern bags,</p>
<p>while I go round the town and beat up</p>
<p>volunteers at once. There are many ships in Ithaca both old and new; I</p>
<p>will run my eye over them for you and will choose the best; we will get</p>
<p>her ready and will put out to sea without delay.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke Minerva daughter of Jove,</p>
<p>and Telemachus lost no time in</p>
<p>doing as the goddess told him. He went moodily home,</p>
<p>and found the</p>
<p>suitors flaying goats and singeing pigs in the outer court. Antinous</p>
<p>came up to him at once and laughed as he took his hand in his own,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>my fine fire-eater,</p>
<p>bear no more ill blood neither</p>
<p>in word nor deed,</p>
<p>but eat and drink with us as you used to do. The</p>
<p>Achaeans will find you in everything‚Äîa ship and a picked crew to</p>
<p>boot‚Äîso that you can set sail for Pylos at once and get news of your</p>
<p>noble father.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI cannot eat in peace,</p>
<p>nor take</p>
<p>pleasure of any kind with such men as you are. Was it not enough that</p>
<p>you should waste so much good property of mine while I was yet a boy?</p>
<p>Now that I am older and know more about it,</p>
<p>I am also stronger,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>whether here among this people,</p>
<p>or by going to Pylos,</p>
<p>I will do you all</p>
<p>the harm I can. I shall go,</p>
<p>and my going will not be in vain‚Äîthough,</p>
<p>thanks to you suitors,</p>
<p>I have neither ship nor crew of my own,</p>
<p>and must</p>
<p>be passenger not captain.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he snatched his hand from that of Antinous. Meanwhile the</p>
<p>others went on getting dinner ready about the buildings,</p>
<p>21 jeering at</p>
<p>him tauntingly as they did so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said one youngster,</p>
<p>‚Äúmeans to be the death of us; I</p>
<p>suppose he thinks he can bring friends to help him from Pylos,</p>
<p>or again</p>
<p>from Sparta,</p>
<p>where he seems bent on going. Or will he go to Ephyra as</p>
<p>well,</p>
<p>for poison to put in our wine and kill us?‚Äù</p>
<p>Another said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúPerhaps if Telemachus goes on board ship,</p>
<p>he will be</p>
<p>like his father and perish far from his friends. In this case we should</p>
<p>have plenty to do,</p>
<p>for we could then divide up his property amongst us:</p>
<p>as for the house we can let his mother and the man who marries her have</p>
<p>that.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was how they talked. But Telemachus went down into the lofty and</p>
<p>spacious store-room where his father‚Äôs treasure of gold and bronze lay</p>
<p>heaped up upon the floor,</p>
<p>and where the linen and spare clothes were</p>
<p>kept in open chests. Here,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>there was a store of fragrant olive</p>
<p>oil,</p>
<p>while casks of old,</p>
<p>well-ripened wine,</p>
<p>unblended and fit for a god</p>
<p>to drink,</p>
<p>were ranged against the wall in case Ulysses should come home</p>
<p>again after all. The room was closed with well-made doors opening in</p>
<p>the middle; moreover the faithful old house-keeper Euryclea,</p>
<p>daughter</p>
<p>of Ops the son of Pisenor,</p>
<p>was in charge of everything both night and</p>
<p>day. Telemachus called her to the store-room and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>draw me off some of the best wine you have,</p>
<p>after what you are</p>
<p>keeping for my father‚Äôs own drinking,</p>
<p>in case,</p>
<p>poor man,</p>
<p>he should</p>
<p>escape death,</p>
<p>and find his way home again after all. Let me have twelve</p>
<p>jars,</p>
<p>and see that they all have lids; also fill me some well-sewn</p>
<p>leathern bags with barley meal‚Äîabout twenty measures in all. Get these</p>
<p>things put together at once,</p>
<p>and say nothing about it. I will take</p>
<p>everything away this evening as soon as my mother has gone upstairs for</p>
<p>the night. I am going to Sparta and to Pylos to see if I can hear</p>
<p>anything about the return of my dear father.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Euryclea heard this she began to cry,</p>
<p>and spoke fondly to him,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear child,</p>
<p>what ever can have put such notion as that into</p>
<p>your head? Where in the world do you want to go to‚Äîyou,</p>
<p>who are the one</p>
<p>hope of the house? Your poor father is dead and gone in some foreign</p>
<p>country nobody knows where,</p>
<p>and as soon as your back is turned these</p>
<p>wicked ones here will be scheming to get you put out of the way,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>will share all your possessions among themselves; stay where you are</p>
<p>among your own people,</p>
<p>and do not go wandering and worrying your life</p>
<p>out on the barren ocean.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFear not,</p>
<p>nurse,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúmy scheme is not without</p>
<p>heaven‚Äôs sanction; but swear that you will say nothing about all this</p>
<p>to my mother,</p>
<p>till I have been away some ten or twelve days,</p>
<p>unless she</p>
<p>hears of my having gone,</p>
<p>and asks you; for I do not want her to spoil</p>
<p>her beauty by crying.‚Äù</p>
<p>The old woman swore most solemnly that she would not,</p>
<p>and when she had</p>
<p>completed her oath,</p>
<p>she began drawing off the wine into jars,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>getting the barley meal into the bags,</p>
<p>while Telemachus went back to</p>
<p>the suitors.</p>
<p>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. She took his shape,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>went round the town to each one of the crew,</p>
<p>telling them to meet at</p>
<p>the ship by sundown. She went also to Noemon son of Phronius,</p>
<p>and asked</p>
<p>him to let her have a ship‚Äîwhich he was very ready to do. When the sun</p>
<p>had set and darkness was over all the land,</p>
<p>she got the ship into the</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>put all the tackle on board her that ships generally carry,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>stationed her at the end of the harbour. Presently the crew came up,</p>
<p>and the goddess spoke encouragingly to each of them.</p>
<p>Furthermore she went to the house of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and threw the suitors</p>
<p>into a deep slumber. She caused their drink to fuddle them,</p>
<p>and made</p>
<p>them drop their cups from their hands,</p>
<p>so that instead of sitting over</p>
<p>their wine,</p>
<p>they went back into the town to sleep,</p>
<p>with their eyes</p>
<p>heavy and full of drowsiness. Then she took the form and voice of</p>
<p>Mentor,</p>
<p>and called Telemachus to come outside.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúthe men are on board and at their oars,</p>
<p>waiting for you to give your orders,</p>
<p>so make haste and let us be off.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this she led the way,</p>
<p>while Telemachus followed in her steps. When</p>
<p>they got to the ship they found the crew waiting by the water side,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow my men,</p>
<p>help me to get the stores on board; they</p>
<p>are all put together in the cloister,</p>
<p>and my mother does not know</p>
<p>anything about it,</p>
<p>nor any of the maid servants except one.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he led the way and the others followed after. When</p>
<p>they had brought the things as he told them,</p>
<p>Telemachus went on board,</p>
<p>Minerva going before him and taking her seat in the stern of the</p>
<p>vessel,</p>
<p>while Telemachus sat beside her. Then the men loosed the</p>
<p>hawsers and took their places on the benches. Minerva sent them a fair</p>
<p>wind from the West,</p>
<p>22 that whistled over the deep blue waves23 whereon</p>
<p>Telemachus told them to catch hold of the ropes and hoist sail,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they did as he told them. They set the mast in its socket in the cross</p>
<p>plank,</p>
<p>raised it,</p>
<p>and made it fast with the forestays; then they</p>
<p>hoisted their white sails aloft with ropes of twisted ox hide. As the</p>
<p>sail bellied out with the wind,</p>
<p>the ship flew through the deep blue</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>and the foam hissed against her bows as she sped onward. Then</p>
<p>they made all fast throughout the ship,</p>
<p>filled the mixing bowls to the</p>
<p>brim,</p>
<p>and made drink offerings to the immortal gods that are from</p>
<p>everlasting,</p>
<p>but more particularly to the grey-eyed daughter of Jove.</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>the ship sped on her way through the watches of the night</p>
<p>from dark till dawn.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK III</span>
<p>TELEMACHUS VISITS NESTOR AT PYLOS.</p>
<p>but as the sun was rising from the fair sea24 into the firmament of</p>
<p>heaven to shed light on mortals and immortals,</p>
<p>they reached Pylos the</p>
<p>city of Neleus. Now the people of Pylos were gathered on the sea shore</p>
<p>to offer sacrifice of black bulls to Neptune lord of the Earthquake.</p>
<p>There were nine guilds with five hundred men in each,</p>
<p>and there were</p>
<p>nine bulls to each guild. As they were eating the inward meats25 and</p>
<p>burning the thigh bones [on the embers] in the name of Neptune,</p>
<p>Telemachus and his crew arrived,</p>
<p>furled their sails,</p>
<p>brought their ship</p>
<p>to anchor,</p>
<p>and went ashore.</p>
<p>Minerva led the way and Telemachus followed her. Presently she said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>you must not be in the least shy or nervous; you have</p>
<p>taken this voyage to try and find out where your father is buried and</p>
<p>how he came by his end; so go straight up to Nestor that we may see</p>
<p>what he has got to tell us. Beg of him to speak the truth,</p>
<p>and he will</p>
<p>tell no lies,</p>
<p>for he is an excellent person.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut how,</p>
<p>Mentor,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúdare I go up to Nestor,</p>
<p>and how</p>
<p>am I to address him? I have never yet been used to holding long</p>
<p>conversations with people,</p>
<p>and am ashamed to begin questioning one who</p>
<p>is so much older than myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome things,</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúwill be suggested to you</p>
<p>by your own instinct,</p>
<p>and heaven will prompt you further; for I am</p>
<p>assured that the gods have been with you from the time of your birth</p>
<p>until now.‚Äù</p>
<p>She then went quickly on,</p>
<p>and Telemachus followed in her steps till</p>
<p>they reached the place where the guilds of the Pylian people were</p>
<p>assembled. There they found Nestor sitting with his sons,</p>
<p>while his</p>
<p>company round him were busy getting dinner ready,</p>
<p>and putting pieces of</p>
<p>meat on to the spits26 while other pieces were cooking. When they saw</p>
<p>the strangers they crowded round them,</p>
<p>took them by the hand and bade</p>
<p>them take their places. Nestor‚Äôs son Pisistratus at once offered his</p>
<p>hand to each of them,</p>
<p>and seated them on some soft sheepskins that were</p>
<p>lying on the sands near his father and his brother Thrasymedes. Then he</p>
<p>gave them their portions of the inward meats and poured wine for them</p>
<p>into a golden cup,</p>
<p>handing it to Minerva first,</p>
<p>and saluting her at the</p>
<p>same time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOffer a prayer,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúto King Neptune,</p>
<p>for it is his feast</p>
<p>that you are joining; when you have duly prayed and made your drink</p>
<p>offering,</p>
<p>pass the cup to your friend that he may do so also. I doubt</p>
<p>not that he too lifts his hands in prayer,</p>
<p>for man cannot live without</p>
<p>God in the world. Still he is younger than you are,</p>
<p>and is much of an</p>
<p>age with myself,</p>
<p>so I will give you the precedence.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he handed her the cup. Minerva thought it very right and</p>
<p>proper of him to have given it to herself first;27 she accordingly</p>
<p>began praying heartily to Neptune. ‚ÄúO thou,</p>
<p>‚Äù she cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat</p>
<p>encirclest the earth,</p>
<p>vouchsafe to grant the prayers of thy servants</p>
<p>that call upon thee. More especially we pray thee send down thy grace</p>
<p>on Nestor and on his sons; thereafter also make the rest of the Pylian</p>
<p>people some handsome return for the goodly hecatomb they are offering</p>
<p>you. Lastly,</p>
<p>grant Telemachus and myself a happy issue,</p>
<p>in respect of</p>
<p>the matter that has brought us in our ship to Pylos.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she had thus made an end of praying,</p>
<p>she handed the cup to</p>
<p>Telemachus and he prayed likewise. By and by,</p>
<p>when the outer meats were</p>
<p>roasted and had been taken off the spits,</p>
<p>the carvers gave every man</p>
<p>his portion and they all made an excellent dinner. As soon as they had</p>
<p>had enough to eat and drink,</p>
<p>Nestor,</p>
<p>knight of Gerene,</p>
<p>began to speak.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat our guests have done their dinner,</p>
<p>it will be</p>
<p>best to ask them who they are. Who,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>sir strangers,</p>
<p>are you,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>from what port have you sailed? Are you traders? or do you sail the</p>
<p>seas as rovers with your hand against every man,</p>
<p>and every man‚Äôs hand</p>
<p>against you?‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus answered boldly,</p>
<p>for Minerva had given him courage to ask</p>
<p>about his father and get himself a good name.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNestor,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúson of Neleus,</p>
<p>honour to the Achaean name,</p>
<p>you ask</p>
<p>whence we come,</p>
<p>and I will tell you. We come from Ithaca under</p>
<p>Neritum,</p>
<p>28 and the matter about which I would speak is of private not</p>
<p>public import. I seek news of my unhappy father Ulysses,</p>
<p>who is said to</p>
<p>have sacked the town of Troy in company with yourself. We know what</p>
<p>fate befell each one of the other heroes who fought at Troy,</p>
<p>but as</p>
<p>regards Ulysses heaven has hidden from us the knowledge even that he is</p>
<p>dead at all,</p>
<p>for no one can certify us in what place he perished,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>say whether he fell in battle on the mainland,</p>
<p>or was lost at sea amid</p>
<p>the waves of Amphitrite. Therefore I am suppliant at your knees,</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>haply you may be pleased to tell me of his melancholy end,</p>
<p>whether you</p>
<p>saw it with your own eyes,</p>
<p>or heard it from some other traveller,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out of any pity for</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>but tell me in all plainness exactly what you saw. If my brave</p>
<p>father Ulysses ever did you loyal service,</p>
<p>either by word or deed,</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>you Achaeans were harassed among the Trojans,</p>
<p>bear it in mind now as in</p>
<p>my favour and tell me truly all.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Nestor,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou recall a time of much sorrow to my</p>
<p>mind,</p>
<p>for the brave Achaeans suffered much both at sea,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>privateering under Achilles,</p>
<p>and when fighting before the great city of</p>
<p>king Priam. Our best men all of them fell there‚ÄîAjax,</p>
<p>Achilles,</p>
<p>Patroclus peer of gods in counsel,</p>
<p>and my own dear son Antilochus,</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>man singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant. But we suffered much</p>
<p>more than this; what mortal tongue indeed could tell the whole story?</p>
<p>Though you were to stay here and question me for five years,</p>
<p>or even</p>
<p>six,</p>
<p>I could not tell you all that the Achaeans suffered,</p>
<p>and you would</p>
<p>turn homeward weary of my tale before it ended. Nine long years did we</p>
<p>try every kind of stratagem,</p>
<p>but the hand of heaven was against us;</p>
<p>during all this time there was no one who could compare with your</p>
<p>father in subtlety‚Äîif indeed you are his son‚ÄîI can hardly believe my</p>
<p>eyes‚Äîand you talk just like him too‚Äîno one would say that people of</p>
<p>such different ages could speak so much alike. He and I never had any</p>
<p>kind of difference from first to last neither in camp nor council,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>in singleness of heart and purpose we advised the Argives how all might</p>
<p>be ordered for the best.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>we had sacked the city of Priam,</p>
<p>and were setting sail</p>
<p>in our ships as heaven had dispersed us,</p>
<p>then Jove saw fit to vex the</p>
<p>Argives on their homeward voyage; for they had not all been either wise</p>
<p>or understanding,</p>
<p>and hence many came to a bad end through the</p>
<p>displeasure of Jove‚Äôs daughter Minerva,</p>
<p>who brought about a quarrel</p>
<p>between the two sons of Atreus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe sons of Atreus called a meeting which was not as it should be,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>it was sunset and the Achaeans were heavy with wine. When they</p>
<p>explained why they had called the people together,</p>
<p>it seemed that</p>
<p>Menelaus was for sailing homeward at once,</p>
<p>and this displeased</p>
<p>Agamemnon,</p>
<p>who thought that we should wait till we had offered</p>
<p>hecatombs to appease the anger of Minerva. Fool that he was,</p>
<p>he might</p>
<p>have known that he would not prevail with her,</p>
<p>for when the gods have</p>
<p>made up their minds they do not change them lightly. So the two stood</p>
<p>bandying hard words,</p>
<p>whereon the Achaeans sprang to their feet with a</p>
<p>cry that rent the air,</p>
<p>and were of two minds as to what they should do.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThat night we rested and nursed our anger,</p>
<p>for Jove was hatching</p>
<p>mischief against us. But in the morning some of us drew our ships into</p>
<p>the water and put our goods with our women on board,</p>
<p>while the rest,</p>
<p>about half in number,</p>
<p>stayed behind with Agamemnon. We‚Äîthe other</p>
<p>half‚Äîembarked and sailed; and the ships went well,</p>
<p>for heaven had</p>
<p>smoothed the sea. When we reached Tenedos we offered sacrifices to the</p>
<p>gods,</p>
<p>for we were longing to get home; cruel Jove,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>did not yet</p>
<p>mean that we should do so,</p>
<p>and raised a second quarrel in the course of</p>
<p>which some among us turned their ships back again,</p>
<p>and sailed away</p>
<p>under Ulysses to make their peace with Agamemnon; but I,</p>
<p>and all the</p>
<p>ships that were with me pressed forward,</p>
<p>for I saw that mischief was</p>
<p>brewing. The son of Tydeus went on also with me,</p>
<p>and his crews with</p>
<p>him. Later on Menelaus joined us at Lesbos,</p>
<p>and found us making up our</p>
<p>minds about our course‚Äîfor we did not know whether to go outside Chios</p>
<p>by the island of Psyra,</p>
<p>keeping this to our left,</p>
<p>or inside Chios,</p>
<p>over</p>
<p>against the stormy headland of Mimas. So we asked heaven for a sign,</p>
<p>and were shown one to the effect that we should be soonest out of</p>
<p>danger if we headed our ships across the open sea to Euboea. This we</p>
<p>therefore did,</p>
<p>and a fair wind sprang up which gave us a quick passage</p>
<p>during the night to Geraestus,</p>
<p>29 where we offered many sacrifices to</p>
<p>Neptune for having helped us so far on our way. Four days later Diomed</p>
<p>and his men stationed their ships in Argos,</p>
<p>but I held on for Pylos,</p>
<p>and the wind never fell light from the day when heaven first made it</p>
<p>fair for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTherefore,</p>
<p>my dear young friend,</p>
<p>I returned without hearing anything</p>
<p>about the others. I know neither who got home safely nor who were lost</p>
<p>but,</p>
<p>as in duty bound,</p>
<p>I will give you without reserve the reports that</p>
<p>have reached me since I have been here in my own house. They say the</p>
<p>Myrmidons returned home safely under Achilles‚Äô son Neoptolemus; so also</p>
<p>did the valiant son of Poias,</p>
<p>Philoctetes. Idomeneus,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>lost no</p>
<p>men at sea,</p>
<p>and all his followers who escaped death in the field got</p>
<p>safe home with him to Crete. No matter how far out of the world you</p>
<p>live,</p>
<p>you will have heard of Agamemnon and the bad end he came to at</p>
<p>the hands of Aegisthus‚Äîand a fearful reckoning did Aegisthus presently</p>
<p>pay. See what a good thing it is for a man to leave a son behind him to</p>
<p>do as Orestes did,</p>
<p>who killed false Aegisthus the murderer of his noble</p>
<p>father. You too,</p>
<p>then‚Äîfor you are a tall smart-looking fellow‚Äîshow your</p>
<p>mettle and make yourself a name in story.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúNestor son of Neleus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúhonour to the Achaean</p>
<p>name,</p>
<p>the Achaeans applaud Orestes and his name will live through all</p>
<p>time for he has avenged his father nobly. Would that heaven might grant</p>
<p>me to do like vengeance on the insolence of the wicked suitors,</p>
<p>who are</p>
<p>ill treating me and plotting my ruin; but the gods have no such</p>
<p>happiness in store for me and for my father,</p>
<p>so we must bear it as best</p>
<p>we may.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Nestor,</p>
<p>‚Äúnow that you remind me,</p>
<p>I remember to have</p>
<p>heard that your mother has many suitors,</p>
<p>who are ill disposed towards</p>
<p>you and are making havoc of your estate. Do you submit to this tamely,</p>
<p>or are public feeling and the voice of heaven against you? Who knows</p>
<p>but what Ulysses may come back after all,</p>
<p>and pay these scoundrels in</p>
<p>full,</p>
<p>either single-handed or with a force of Achaeans behind him? If</p>
<p>Minerva were to take as great a liking to you as she did to Ulysses</p>
<p>when we were fighting before Troy (for I never yet saw the gods so</p>
<p>openly fond of any one as Minerva then was of your father),</p>
<p>if she</p>
<p>would take as good care of you as she did of him,</p>
<p>these wooers would</p>
<p>soon some of them forget their wooing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can expect nothing of the kind; it would be far</p>
<p>too much to hope for. I dare not let myself think of it. Even though</p>
<p>the gods themselves willed it no such good fortune could befall me.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? Heaven</p>
<p>has a long arm if it is minded to save a man; and if it were me,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>should not care how much I suffered before getting home,</p>
<p>provided I</p>
<p>could be safe when I was once there. I would rather this,</p>
<p>than get home</p>
<p>quickly,</p>
<p>and then be killed in my own house as Agamemnon was by the</p>
<p>treachery of Aegisthus and his wife. Still,</p>
<p>death is certain,</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>a man‚Äôs hour is come,</p>
<p>not even the gods can save him,</p>
<p>no matter how</p>
<p>fond they are of him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMentor,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not let us talk about it any more.</p>
<p>There is no chance of my father‚Äôs ever coming back; the gods have long</p>
<p>since counselled his destruction. There is something else,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>about which I should like to ask Nestor,</p>
<p>for he knows much more than</p>
<p>any one else does. They say he has reigned for three generations so</p>
<p>that it is like talking to an immortal. Tell me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>Nestor,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>tell me true; how did Agamemnon come to die in that way? What was</p>
<p>Menelaus doing? And how came false Aegisthus to kill so far better a</p>
<p>man than himself? Was Menelaus away from Achaean Argos,</p>
<p>voyaging</p>
<p>elsewhither among mankind,</p>
<p>that Aegisthus took heart and killed</p>
<p>Agamemnon?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you truly,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Nestor,</p>
<p>‚Äúand indeed you have yourself</p>
<p>divined how it all happened. If Menelaus when he got back from Troy had</p>
<p>found Aegisthus still alive in his house,</p>
<p>there would have been no</p>
<p>barrow heaped up for him,</p>
<p>not even when he was dead,</p>
<p>but he would have</p>
<p>been thrown outside the city to dogs and vultures,</p>
<p>and not a woman</p>
<p>would have mourned him,</p>
<p>for he had done a deed of great wickedness; but</p>
<p>we were over there,</p>
<p>fighting hard at Troy,</p>
<p>and Aegisthus,</p>
<p>who was</p>
<p>taking his ease quietly in the heart of Argos,</p>
<p>cajoled Agamemnon‚Äôs wife</p>
<p>Clytemnestra with incessant flattery.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt first she would have nothing to do with his wicked scheme,</p>
<p>for she</p>
<p>was of a good natural disposition;30 moreover there was a bard with</p>
<p>her,</p>
<p>to whom Agamemnon had given strict orders on setting out for Troy,</p>
<p>that he was to keep guard over his wife; but when heaven had counselled</p>
<p>her destruction,</p>
<p>Aegisthus carried this bard off to a desert island and</p>
<p>left him there for crows and seagulls to batten upon‚Äîafter which she</p>
<p>went willingly enough to the house of Aegisthus. Then he offered many</p>
<p>burnt sacrifices to the gods,</p>
<p>and decorated many temples with</p>
<p>tapestries and gilding,</p>
<p>for he had succeeded far beyond his</p>
<p>expectations.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile Menelaus and I were on our way home from Troy,</p>
<p>on good terms</p>
<p>with one another. When we got to Sunium,</p>
<p>which is the point of Athens,</p>
<p>Apollo with his painless shafts killed Phrontis the steersman of</p>
<p>Menelaus‚Äô ship (and never man knew better how to handle a vessel in</p>
<p>rough weather) so that he died then and there with the helm in his</p>
<p>hand,</p>
<p>and Menelaus,</p>
<p>though very anxious to press forward,</p>
<p>had to wait</p>
<p>in order to bury his comrade and give him his due funeral rites.</p>
<p>Presently,</p>
<p>when he too could put to sea again,</p>
<p>and had sailed on as far</p>
<p>as the Malean heads,</p>
<p>Jove counselled evil against him and made it blow</p>
<p>hard till the waves ran mountains high. Here he divided his fleet and</p>
<p>took the one half towards Crete where the Cydonians dwell round about</p>
<p>the waters of the river Iardanus. There is a high headland hereabouts</p>
<p>stretching out into the sea from a place called Gortyn,</p>
<p>and all along</p>
<p>this part of the coast as far as Phaestus the sea runs high when there</p>
<p>is a south wind blowing,</p>
<p>but after Phaestus the coast is more</p>
<p>protected,</p>
<p>for a small headland can make a great shelter. Here this</p>
<p>part of the fleet was driven on to the rocks and wrecked; but the crews</p>
<p>just managed to save themselves. As for the other five ships,</p>
<p>they were</p>
<p>taken by winds and seas to Egypt,</p>
<p>where Menelaus gathered much gold and</p>
<p>substance among people of an alien speech. Meanwhile Aegisthus here at</p>
<p>home plotted his evil deed. For seven years after he had killed</p>
<p>Agamemnon he ruled in Mycene,</p>
<p>and the people were obedient under him,</p>
<p>but in the eighth year Orestes came back from Athens to be his bane,</p>
<p>and killed the murderer of his father. Then he celebrated the funeral</p>
<p>rites of his mother and of false Aegisthus by a banquet to the people</p>
<p>of Argos,</p>
<p>and on that very day Menelaus came home,</p>
<p>31 with as much</p>
<p>treasure as his ships could carry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake my advice then,</p>
<p>and do not go travelling about for long so far</p>
<p>from home,</p>
<p>nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your</p>
<p>house; they will eat up everything you have among them,</p>
<p>and you will</p>
<p>have been on a fool‚Äôs errand. Still,</p>
<p>I should advise you by all means</p>
<p>to go and visit Menelaus,</p>
<p>who has lately come off a voyage among such</p>
<p>distant peoples as no man could ever hope to get back from,</p>
<p>when the</p>
<p>winds had once carried him so far out of his reckoning; even birds</p>
<p>cannot fly the distance in a twelve-month,</p>
<p>so vast and terrible are the</p>
<p>seas that they must cross. Go to him,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>by sea,</p>
<p>and take your</p>
<p>own men with you; or if you would rather travel by land you can have a</p>
<p>chariot,</p>
<p>you can have horses,</p>
<p>and here are my sons who can escort you</p>
<p>to Lacedaemon where Menelaus lives. Beg of him to speak the truth,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he will tell you no lies,</p>
<p>for he is an excellent person.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke the sun set and it came on dark,</p>
<p>whereon Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>all that you have said is well; now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>order the tongues</p>
<p>of the victims to be cut,</p>
<p>and mix wine that we may make drink-offerings</p>
<p>to Neptune,</p>
<p>and the other immortals,</p>
<p>and then go to bed,</p>
<p>for it is bed</p>
<p>time. People should go away early and not keep late hours at a</p>
<p>religious festival.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke the daughter of Jove,</p>
<p>and they obeyed her saying. Men</p>
<p>servants poured water over the hands of the guests,</p>
<p>while pages filled</p>
<p>the mixing-bowls with wine and water,</p>
<p>and handed it round after giving</p>
<p>every man his drink offering; then they threw the tongues of the</p>
<p>victims into the fire,</p>
<p>and stood up to make their drink offerings. When</p>
<p>they had made their offerings and had drunk each as much as he was</p>
<p>minded,</p>
<p>Minerva and Telemachus were for going on board their ship,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Nestor caught them up at once and stayed them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHeaven and the immortal gods,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúforbid that you should</p>
<p>leave my house to go on board of a ship. Do you think I am so poor and</p>
<p>short of clothes,</p>
<p>or that I have so few cloaks and as to be unable to</p>
<p>find comfortable beds both for myself and for my guests? Let me tell</p>
<p>you I have store both of rugs and cloaks,</p>
<p>and shall not permit the son</p>
<p>of my old friend Ulysses to camp down on the deck of a ship‚Äînot while I</p>
<p>live‚Äînor yet will my sons after me,</p>
<p>but they will keep open house as I</p>
<p>have done.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Minerva answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>you have spoken well,</p>
<p>and it will be much</p>
<p>better that Telemachus should do as you have said; he,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>shall</p>
<p>return with you and sleep at your house,</p>
<p>but I must go back to give</p>
<p>orders to my crew,</p>
<p>and keep them in good heart. I am the only older</p>
<p>person among them; the rest are all young men of Telemachus‚Äô own age,</p>
<p>who have taken this voyage out of friendship; so I must return to the</p>
<p>ship and sleep there. Moreover to-morrow I must go to the Cauconians</p>
<p>where I have a large sum of money long owing to me. As for Telemachus,</p>
<p>now that he is your guest,</p>
<p>send him to Lacedaemon in a chariot,</p>
<p>and let</p>
<p>one of your sons go with him. Be pleased to also provide him with your</p>
<p>best and fleetest horses.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she had thus spoken,</p>
<p>she flew away in the form of an eagle,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>all marvelled as they beheld it. Nestor was astonished,</p>
<p>and took</p>
<p>Telemachus by the hand. ‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see that you are going</p>
<p>to be a great hero some day,</p>
<p>since the gods wait upon you thus while</p>
<p>you are still so young. This can have been none other of those who</p>
<p>dwell in heaven than Jove‚Äôs redoubtable daughter,</p>
<p>the Trito-born,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>shewed such favour towards your brave father among the Argives. Holy</p>
<p>queen,</p>
<p>‚Äù he continued,</p>
<p>‚Äúvouchsafe to send down thy grace upon myself,</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>good wife,</p>
<p>and my children. In return,</p>
<p>I will offer you in sacrifice a</p>
<p>broad-browed heifer of a year old,</p>
<p>unbroken,</p>
<p>and never yet brought by</p>
<p>man under the yoke. I will gild her horns,</p>
<p>and will offer her up to you</p>
<p>in sacrifice.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he pray,</p>
<p>and Minerva heard his prayer. He then led the way to</p>
<p>his own house,</p>
<p>followed by his sons and sons in law. When they had got</p>
<p>there and had taken their places on the benches and seats,</p>
<p>he mixed</p>
<p>them a bowl of sweet wine that was eleven years old when the</p>
<p>housekeeper took the lid off the jar that held it. As he mixed the</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>he prayed much and made drink offerings to Minerva,</p>
<p>daughter of</p>
<p>Aegis-bearing Jove. Then,</p>
<p>when they had made their drink offerings and</p>
<p>had drunk each as much as he was minded,</p>
<p>the others went home to bed</p>
<p>each in his own abode; but Nestor put Telemachus to sleep in the room</p>
<p>that was over the gateway along with Pisistratus,</p>
<p>who was the only</p>
<p>unmarried son now left him. As for himself,</p>
<p>he slept in an inner room</p>
<p>of the house,</p>
<p>with the queen his wife by his side.</p>
<p>Now when the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>Nestor left</p>
<p>his couch and took his seat on the benches of white and polished marble</p>
<p>that stood in front of his house. Here aforetime sat Neleus,</p>
<p>peer of</p>
<p>gods in counsel,</p>
<p>but he was now dead,</p>
<p>and had gone to the house of</p>
<p>Hades; so Nestor sat in his seat sceptre in hand,</p>
<p>as guardian of the</p>
<p>public weal. His sons as they left their rooms gathered round him,</p>
<p>Echephron,</p>
<p>Stratius,</p>
<p>Perseus,</p>
<p>Aretus,</p>
<p>and Thrasymedes; the sixth son</p>
<p>was Pisistratus,</p>
<p>and when Telemachus joined them they made him sit with</p>
<p>them. Nestor then addressed them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy sons,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúmake haste to do as I shall bid you. I wish first</p>
<p>and foremost to propitiate the great goddess Minerva,</p>
<p>who manifested</p>
<p>herself visibly to me during yesterday‚Äôs festivities. Go,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>one or</p>
<p>other of you to the plain,</p>
<p>tell the stockman to look me out a heifer,</p>
<p>and come on here with it at once. Another must go to Telemachus‚Äô ship,</p>
<p>and invite all the crew,</p>
<p>leaving two men only in charge of the vessel.</p>
<p>Some one else will run and fetch Laerceus the goldsmith to gild the</p>
<p>horns of the heifer. The rest,</p>
<p>stay all of you where you are; tell the</p>
<p>maids in the house to prepare an excellent dinner,</p>
<p>and to fetch seats,</p>
<p>and logs of wood for a burnt offering. Tell them also to bring me some</p>
<p>clear spring water.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this they hurried off on their several errands. The heifer was</p>
<p>brought in from the plain,</p>
<p>and Telemachus‚Äôs crew came from the ship;</p>
<p>the goldsmith brought the anvil,</p>
<p>hammer,</p>
<p>and tongs,</p>
<p>with which he</p>
<p>worked his gold,</p>
<p>and Minerva herself came to accept the sacrifice.</p>
<p>Nestor gave out the gold,</p>
<p>and the smith gilded the horns of the heifer</p>
<p>that the goddess might have pleasure in their beauty. Then Stratius and</p>
<p>Echephron brought her in by the horns; Aretus fetched water from the</p>
<p>house in a ewer that had a flower pattern on it,</p>
<p>and in his other hand</p>
<p>he held a basket of barley meal; sturdy Thrasymedes stood by with a</p>
<p>sharp axe,</p>
<p>ready to strike the heifer,</p>
<p>while Perseus held a bucket.</p>
<p>Then Nestor began with washing his hands and sprinkling the barley</p>
<p>meal,</p>
<p>and he offered many a prayer to Minerva as he threw a lock from</p>
<p>the heifer‚Äôs head upon the fire.</p>
<p>When they had done praying and sprinkling the barley meal32 Thrasymedes</p>
<p>dealt his blow,</p>
<p>and brought the heifer down with a stroke that cut</p>
<p>through the tendons at the base of her neck,</p>
<p>whereon the daughters and</p>
<p>daughters in law of Nestor,</p>
<p>and his venerable wife Eurydice (she was</p>
<p>eldest daughter to Clymenus) screamed with delight. Then they lifted</p>
<p>the heifer‚Äôs head from off the ground,</p>
<p>and Pisistratus cut her throat.</p>
<p>When she had done bleeding and was quite dead,</p>
<p>they cut her up. They</p>
<p>cut out the thigh bones all in due course,</p>
<p>wrapped them round in two</p>
<p>layers of fat,</p>
<p>and set some pieces of raw meat on the top of them; then</p>
<p>Nestor laid them upon the wood fire and poured wine over them,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>the young men stood near him with five-pronged spits in their hands.</p>
<p>When the thighs were burned and they had tasted the inward meats,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>cut the rest of the meat up small,</p>
<p>put the pieces on the spits and</p>
<p>toasted them over the fire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile lovely Polycaste,</p>
<p>Nestor‚Äôs youngest daughter,</p>
<p>washed</p>
<p>Telemachus. When she had washed him and anointed him with oil,</p>
<p>she</p>
<p>brought him a fair mantle and shirt,</p>
<p>33 and he looked like a god as he</p>
<p>came from the bath and took his seat by the side of Nestor. When the</p>
<p>outer meats were done they drew them off the spits and sat down to</p>
<p>dinner where they were waited upon by some worthy henchmen,</p>
<p>who kept</p>
<p>pouring them out their wine in cups of gold. As soon as they had had</p>
<p>enough to eat and drink Nestor said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSons,</p>
<p>put Telemachus‚Äôs horses to</p>
<p>the chariot that he may start at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they did even as he had said,</p>
<p>and yoked the</p>
<p>fleet horses to the chariot. The housekeeper packed them up a provision</p>
<p>of bread,</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>and sweet meats fit for the sons of princes. Then</p>
<p>Telemachus got into the chariot,</p>
<p>while Pisistratus gathered up the</p>
<p>reins and took his seat beside him. He lashed the horses on and they</p>
<p>flew forward nothing loth into the open country,</p>
<p>leaving the high</p>
<p>citadel of Pylos behind them. All that day did they travel,</p>
<p>swaying the</p>
<p>yoke upon their necks till the sun went down and darkness was over all</p>
<p>the land. Then they reached Pherae where Diocles lived,</p>
<p>who was son to</p>
<p>Ortilochus and grandson to Alpheus. Here they passed the night and</p>
<p>Diocles entertained them hospitably. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>they again yoked their horses and drove</p>
<p>out through the gateway under the echoing gatehouse.34 Pisistratus</p>
<p>lashed the horses on and they flew forward nothing loth; presently they</p>
<p>came to the corn lands of the open country,</p>
<p>and in the course of time</p>
<p>completed their journey,</p>
<p>so well did their steeds take them.35</p>
<p>Now when the sun had set and darkness was over the land,</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK IV</span>
<p>THE VISIT TO KING MENELAUS,</p>
<p>WHO TELLS HIS STORY‚ÄîMEANWHILE THE SUITORS</p>
<p>IN ITHACA PLOT AGAINST TELEMACHUS.</p>
<p>they reached the low lying city of Lacedaemon,</p>
<p>where they drove</p>
<p>straight to the abode of Menelaus36 [and found him in his own house,</p>
<p>feasting with his many clansmen in honour of the wedding of his son,</p>
<p>and also of his daughter,</p>
<p>whom he was marrying to the son of that</p>
<p>valiant warrior Achilles. He had given his consent and promised her to</p>
<p>him while he was still at Troy,</p>
<p>and now the gods were bringing the</p>
<p>marriage about; so he was sending her with chariots and horses to the</p>
<p>city of the Myrmidons over whom Achilles‚Äô son was reigning. For his</p>
<p>only son he had found a bride from Sparta,</p>
<p>37 the daughter of Alector.</p>
<p>This son,</p>
<p>Megapenthes,</p>
<p>was born to him of a bondwoman,</p>
<p>for heaven</p>
<p>vouchsafed Helen no more children after she had borne Hermione,</p>
<p>who was</p>
<p>fair as golden Venus herself.</p>
<p>So the neighbours and kinsmen of Menelaus were feasting and making</p>
<p>merry in his house. There was a bard also to sing to them and play his</p>
<p>lyre,</p>
<p>while two tumblers went about performing in the midst of them</p>
<p>when the man struck up with his tune.38</p>
<p>Telemachus and the son of Nestor stayed their horses at the gate,</p>
<p>whereon Eteoneus servant to Menelaus came out,</p>
<p>and as soon as he saw</p>
<p>them ran hurrying back into the house to tell his Master. He went close</p>
<p>up to him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMenelaus,</p>
<p>there are some strangers come here,</p>
<p>two</p>
<p>men,</p>
<p>who look like sons of Jove. What are we to do? Shall we take their</p>
<p>horses out,</p>
<p>or tell them to find friends elsewhere as they best can?‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus was very angry and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEteoneus,</p>
<p>son of Boethous,</p>
<p>you never</p>
<p>used to be a fool,</p>
<p>but now you talk like a simpleton. Take their horses</p>
<p>out,</p>
<p>of course,</p>
<p>and show the strangers in that they may have supper;</p>
<p>you and I have staid often enough at other people‚Äôs houses before we</p>
<p>got back here,</p>
<p>where heaven grant that we may rest in peace</p>
<p>henceforward.‚Äù</p>
<p>So Eteoneus bustled back and bade the other servants come with him.</p>
<p>They took their sweating steeds from under the yoke,</p>
<p>made them fast to</p>
<p>the mangers,</p>
<p>and gave them a feed of oats and barley mixed. Then they</p>
<p>leaned the chariot against the end wall of the courtyard,</p>
<p>and led the</p>
<p>way into the house. Telemachus and Pisistratus were astonished when</p>
<p>they saw it,</p>
<p>for its splendour was as that of the sun and moon; then,</p>
<p>when they had admired everything to their heart‚Äôs content,</p>
<p>they went</p>
<p>into the bath room and washed themselves.</p>
<p>When the servants had washed them and anointed them with oil,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>brought them woollen cloaks and shirts,</p>
<p>and the two took their seats by</p>
<p>the side of Menelaus. A maid-servant brought them water in a beautiful</p>
<p>golden ewer,</p>
<p>and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their</p>
<p>hands; and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought</p>
<p>them bread,</p>
<p>and offered them many good things of what there was in the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>while the carver fetched them plates of all manner of meats and</p>
<p>set cups of gold by their side.</p>
<p>Menelaus then greeted them saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFall to,</p>
<p>and welcome; when you have</p>
<p>done supper I shall ask who you are,</p>
<p>for the lineage of such men as you</p>
<p>cannot have been lost. You must be descended from a line of</p>
<p>sceptre-bearing kings,</p>
<p>for poor people do not have such sons as you</p>
<p>are.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he handed them39 a piece of fat roast loin,</p>
<p>which had been set</p>
<p>near him as being a prime part,</p>
<p>and they laid their hands on the good</p>
<p>things that were before them; as soon as they had had enough to eat and</p>
<p>drink,</p>
<p>Telemachus said to the son of Nestor,</p>
<p>with his head so close</p>
<p>that no one might hear,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook,</p>
<p>Pisistratus,</p>
<p>man after my own heart,</p>
<p>see</p>
<p>the gleam of bronze and gold‚Äîof amber,</p>
<p>40 ivory,</p>
<p>and silver. Everything</p>
<p>is so splendid that it is like seeing the palace of Olympian Jove. I am</p>
<p>lost in admiration.‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus overheard him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one,</p>
<p>my sons,</p>
<p>can hold his own</p>
<p>with Jove,</p>
<p>for his house and everything about him is immortal; but</p>
<p>among mortal men‚Äîwell,</p>
<p>there may be another who has as much wealth as I</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>or there may not; but at all events I have travelled much and</p>
<p>have undergone much hardship,</p>
<p>for it was nearly eight years before I</p>
<p>could get home with my fleet. I went to Cyprus,</p>
<p>Phoenicia and the</p>
<p>Egyptians; I went also to the Ethiopians,</p>
<p>the Sidonians,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>Erembians,</p>
<p>and to Libya where the lambs have horns as soon as they are</p>
<p>born,</p>
<p>and the sheep lamb down three times a year. Every one in that</p>
<p>country,</p>
<p>whether master or man,</p>
<p>has plenty of cheese,</p>
<p>meat,</p>
<p>and good</p>
<p>milk,</p>
<p>for the ewes yield all the year round. But while I was travelling</p>
<p>and getting great riches among these people,</p>
<p>my brother was secretly</p>
<p>and shockingly murdered through the perfidy of his wicked wife,</p>
<p>so that</p>
<p>I have no pleasure in being lord of all this wealth. Whoever your</p>
<p>parents may be they must have told you about all this,</p>
<p>and of my heavy</p>
<p>loss in the ruin41 of a stately mansion fully and magnificently</p>
<p>furnished. Would that I had only a third of what I now have so that I</p>
<p>had stayed at home,</p>
<p>and all those were living who perished on the plain</p>
<p>of Troy,</p>
<p>far from Argos. I often grieve,</p>
<p>as I sit here in my house,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>one and all of them. At times I cry aloud for sorrow,</p>
<p>but presently I</p>
<p>leave off again,</p>
<p>for crying is cold comfort and one soon tires of it.</p>
<p>Yet grieve for these as I may,</p>
<p>I do so for one man more than for them</p>
<p>all. I cannot even think of him without loathing both food and sleep,</p>
<p>so miserable does he make me,</p>
<p>for no one of all the Achaeans worked so</p>
<p>hard or risked so much as he did. He took nothing by it,</p>
<p>and has left a</p>
<p>legacy of sorrow to myself,</p>
<p>for he has been gone a long time,</p>
<p>and we</p>
<p>know not whether he is alive or dead. His old father,</p>
<p>his</p>
<p>long-suffering wife Penelope,</p>
<p>and his son Telemachus,</p>
<p>whom he left</p>
<p>behind him an infant in arms,</p>
<p>are plunged in grief on his account.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke Menelaus,</p>
<p>and the heart of Telemachus yearned as he</p>
<p>bethought him of his father. Tears fell from his eyes as he heard him</p>
<p>thus mentioned,</p>
<p>so that he held his cloak before his face with both</p>
<p>hands. When Menelaus saw this he doubted whether to let him choose his</p>
<p>own time for speaking,</p>
<p>or to ask him at once and find what it was all</p>
<p>about.</p>
<p>While he was thus in two minds Helen came down from her high vaulted</p>
<p>and perfumed room,</p>
<p>looking as lovely as Diana herself. Adraste brought</p>
<p>her a seat,</p>
<p>Alcippe a soft woollen rug while Phylo fetched her the</p>
<p>silver work-box which Alcandra wife of Polybus had given her. Polybus</p>
<p>lived in Egyptian Thebes,</p>
<p>which is the richest city in the whole world;</p>
<p>he gave Menelaus two baths,</p>
<p>both of pure silver,</p>
<p>two tripods,</p>
<p>and ten</p>
<p>talents of gold; besides all this,</p>
<p>his wife gave Helen some beautiful</p>
<p>presents,</p>
<p>to wit,</p>
<p>a golden distaff,</p>
<p>and a silver work box that ran on</p>
<p>wheels,</p>
<p>with a gold band round the top of it. Phylo now placed this by</p>
<p>her side,</p>
<p>full of fine spun yarn,</p>
<p>and a distaff charged with violet</p>
<p>coloured wool was laid upon the top of it. Then Helen took her seat,</p>
<p>put her feet upon the footstool,</p>
<p>and began to question her husband.42</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo we know,</p>
<p>Menelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúthe names of these strangers who</p>
<p>have come to visit us? Shall I guess right or wrong?‚Äîbut I cannot help</p>
<p>saying what I think. Never yet have I seen either man or woman so like</p>
<p>somebody else (indeed when I look at him I hardly know what to think)</p>
<p>as this young man is like Telemachus,</p>
<p>whom Ulysses left as a baby</p>
<p>behind him,</p>
<p>when you Achaeans went to Troy with battle in your hearts,</p>
<p>on account of my most shameless self.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear wife,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Menelaus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see the likeness just as you do.</p>
<p>His hands and feet are just like Ulysses; so is his hair,</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>shape of his head and the expression of his eyes. Moreover,</p>
<p>when I was</p>
<p>talking about Ulysses,</p>
<p>and saying how much he had suffered on my</p>
<p>account,</p>
<p>tears fell from his eyes,</p>
<p>and he hid his face in his mantle.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Pisistratus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMenelaus,</p>
<p>son of Atreus,</p>
<p>you are right in</p>
<p>thinking that this young man is Telemachus,</p>
<p>but he is very modest,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>is ashamed to come here and begin opening up discourse with one whose</p>
<p>conversation is so divinely interesting as your own. My father,</p>
<p>Nestor,</p>
<p>sent me to escort him hither,</p>
<p>for he wanted to know whether you could</p>
<p>give him any counsel or suggestion. A son has always trouble at home</p>
<p>when his father has gone away leaving him without supporters; and this</p>
<p>is how Telemachus is now placed,</p>
<p>for his father is absent,</p>
<p>and there is</p>
<p>no one among his own people to stand by him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúBless my heart,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Menelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äúthen I am receiving a visit from</p>
<p>the son of a very dear friend,</p>
<p>who suffered much hardship for my sake.</p>
<p>I had always hoped to entertain him with most marked distinction when</p>
<p>heaven had granted us a safe return from beyond the seas. I should have</p>
<p>founded a city for him in Argos,</p>
<p>and built him a house. I should have</p>
<p>made him leave Ithaca with his goods,</p>
<p>his son,</p>
<p>and all his people,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>should have sacked for them some one of the neighbouring cities that</p>
<p>are subject to me. We should thus have seen one another continually,</p>
<p>and nothing but death could have interrupted so close and happy an</p>
<p>intercourse. I suppose,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that heaven grudged us such great good</p>
<p>fortune,</p>
<p>for it has prevented the poor fellow from ever getting home at</p>
<p>all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and his words set them all a weeping. Helen wept,</p>
<p>Telemachus wept,</p>
<p>and so did Menelaus,</p>
<p>nor could Pisistratus keep his</p>
<p>eyes from filling,</p>
<p>when he remembered his dear brother Antilochus whom</p>
<p>the son of bright Dawn had killed. Thereon he said to Menelaus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>my father Nestor,</p>
<p>when we used to talk about you at home,</p>
<p>told me</p>
<p>you were a person of rare and excellent understanding. If,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>it be</p>
<p>possible,</p>
<p>do as I would urge you. I am not fond of crying while I am</p>
<p>getting my supper. Morning will come in due course,</p>
<p>and in the forenoon</p>
<p>I care not how much I cry for those that are dead and gone. This is all</p>
<p>we can do for the poor things. We can only shave our heads for them and</p>
<p>wring the tears from our cheeks. I had a brother who died at Troy; he</p>
<p>was by no means the worst man there; you are sure to have known him‚Äîhis</p>
<p>name was Antilochus; I never set eyes upon him myself,</p>
<p>but they say</p>
<p>that he was singularly fleet of foot and in fight valiant.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour discretion,</p>
<p>my friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Menelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äúis beyond your years.</p>
<p>It is plain you take after your father. One can soon see when a man is</p>
<p>son to one whom heaven has blessed both as regards wife and</p>
<p>offspring‚Äîand it has blessed Nestor from first to last all his days,</p>
<p>giving him a green old age in his own house,</p>
<p>with sons about him who</p>
<p>are both well disposed and valiant. We will put an end therefore to all</p>
<p>this weeping,</p>
<p>and attend to our supper again. Let water be poured over</p>
<p>our hands. Telemachus and I can talk with one another fully in the</p>
<p>morning.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Asphalion,</p>
<p>one of the servants,</p>
<p>poured water over their hands</p>
<p>and they laid their hands on the good things that were before them.</p>
<p>Then Jove‚Äôs daughter Helen bethought her of another matter. She drugged</p>
<p>the wine with an herb that banishes all care,</p>
<p>sorrow,</p>
<p>and ill humour.</p>
<p>Whoever drinks wine thus drugged cannot shed a single tear all the rest</p>
<p>of the day,</p>
<p>not even though his father and mother both of them drop</p>
<p>down dead,</p>
<p>or he sees a brother or a son hewn in pieces before his very</p>
<p>eyes. This drug,</p>
<p>of such sovereign power and virtue,</p>
<p>had been given to</p>
<p>Helen by Polydamna wife of Thon,</p>
<p>a woman of Egypt,</p>
<p>where there grow all</p>
<p>sorts of herbs,</p>
<p>some good to put into the mixing bowl and others</p>
<p>poisonous. Moreover,</p>
<p>every one in the whole country is a skilled</p>
<p>physician,</p>
<p>for they are of the race of Paeeon. When Helen had put this</p>
<p>drug in the bowl,</p>
<p>and had told the servants to serve the wine round,</p>
<p>she said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMenelaus,</p>
<p>son of Atreus,</p>
<p>and you my good friends,</p>
<p>sons of honourable</p>
<p>men (which is as Jove wills,</p>
<p>for he is the giver both of good and evil,</p>
<p>and can do what he chooses),</p>
<p>feast here as you will,</p>
<p>and listen while I</p>
<p>tell you a tale in season. I cannot indeed name every single one of the</p>
<p>exploits of Ulysses,</p>
<p>but I can say what he did when he was before Troy,</p>
<p>and you Achaeans were in all sorts of difficulties. He covered himself</p>
<p>with wounds and bruises,</p>
<p>dressed himself all in rags,</p>
<p>and entered the</p>
<p>enemy‚Äôs city looking like a menial or a beggar,</p>
<p>and quite different</p>
<p>from what he did when he was among his own people. In this disguise he</p>
<p>entered the city of Troy,</p>
<p>and no one said anything to him. I alone</p>
<p>recognised him and began to question him,</p>
<p>but he was too cunning for</p>
<p>me. When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I had washed and anointed him and had given him</p>
<p>clothes,</p>
<p>and after I had sworn a solemn oath not to betray him to the</p>
<p>Trojans till he had got safely back to his own camp and to the ships,</p>
<p>he told me all that the Achaeans meant to do. He killed many Trojans</p>
<p>and got much information before he reached the Argive camp,</p>
<p>for all</p>
<p>which things the Trojan women made lamentation,</p>
<p>but for my own part I</p>
<p>was glad,</p>
<p>for my heart was beginning to yearn after my home,</p>
<p>and I was</p>
<p>unhappy about the wrong that Venus had done me in taking me over there,</p>
<p>away from my country,</p>
<p>my girl,</p>
<p>and my lawful wedded husband,</p>
<p>who is</p>
<p>indeed by no means deficient either in person or understanding.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Menelaus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll that you have been saying,</p>
<p>my dear wife,</p>
<p>is</p>
<p>true. I have travelled much,</p>
<p>and have had much to do with heroes,</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>have never seen such another man as Ulysses. What endurance too,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>what courage he displayed within the wooden horse,</p>
<p>wherein all the</p>
<p>bravest of the Argives were lying in wait to bring death and</p>
<p>destruction upon the Trojans.43 At that moment you came up to us; some</p>
<p>god who wished well to the Trojans must have set you on to it and you</p>
<p>had Deiphobus with you. Three times did you go all round our hiding</p>
<p>place and pat it; you called our chiefs each by his own name,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>mimicked all our wives‚ÄîDiomed,</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>and I from our seats inside</p>
<p>heard what a noise you made. Diomed and I could not make up our minds</p>
<p>whether to spring out then and there,</p>
<p>or to answer you from inside,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Ulysses held us all in check,</p>
<p>so we sat quite still,</p>
<p>all except</p>
<p>Anticlus,</p>
<p>who was beginning to answer you,</p>
<p>when Ulysses clapped his two</p>
<p>brawny hands over his mouth,</p>
<p>and kept them there. It was this that</p>
<p>saved us all,</p>
<p>for he muzzled Anticlus till Minerva took you away</p>
<p>again.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHow sad,</p>
<p>‚Äù exclaimed Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat all this was of no avail to save</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>nor yet his own iron courage. But now,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>be pleased to send us</p>
<p>all to bed,</p>
<p>that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon of sleep.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Helen told the maid servants to set beds in the room that was</p>
<p>in the gatehouse,</p>
<p>and to make them with good red rugs,</p>
<p>and spread</p>
<p>coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for the guests to</p>
<p>wear. So the maids went out,</p>
<p>carrying a torch,</p>
<p>and made the beds,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>which a man-servant presently conducted the strangers. Thus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>did</p>
<p>Telemachus and Pisistratus sleep there in the forecourt,</p>
<p>while the son</p>
<p>of Atreus lay in an inner room with lovely Helen by his side.</p>
<p>When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>Menelaus rose</p>
<p>and dressed himself. He bound his sandals on to his comely feet,</p>
<p>girded</p>
<p>his sword about his shoulders,</p>
<p>and left his room looking like an</p>
<p>immortal god. Then,</p>
<p>taking a seat near Telemachus he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what,</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>has led you to take this long sea voyage to</p>
<p>Lacedaemon? Are you on public,</p>
<p>or private business? Tell me all about</p>
<p>it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have come,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúto see if you can tell me</p>
<p>anything about my father. I am being eaten out of house and home; my</p>
<p>fair estate is being wasted,</p>
<p>and my house is full of miscreants who</p>
<p>keep killing great numbers of my sheep and oxen,</p>
<p>on the pretence of</p>
<p>paying their addresses to my mother. Therefore,</p>
<p>I am suppliant at your</p>
<p>knees if haply you may tell me about my father‚Äôs melancholy end,</p>
<p>whether you saw it with your own eyes,</p>
<p>or heard it from some other</p>
<p>traveller; for he was a man born to trouble. Do not soften things out</p>
<p>of any pity for myself,</p>
<p>but tell me in all plainness exactly what you</p>
<p>saw. If my brave father Ulysses ever did you loyal service either by</p>
<p>word or deed,</p>
<p>when you Achaeans were harassed by the Trojans,</p>
<p>bear it</p>
<p>in mind now as in my favour and tell me truly all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus on hearing this was very much shocked. ‚ÄúSo,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúthese cowards would usurp a brave man‚Äôs bed? A hind might as well lay</p>
<p>her new born young in the lair of a lion,</p>
<p>and then go off to feed in</p>
<p>the forest or in some grassy dell: the lion when he comes back to his</p>
<p>lair will make short work with the pair of them‚Äîand so will Ulysses</p>
<p>with these suitors. By father Jove,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and Apollo,</p>
<p>if Ulysses is</p>
<p>still the man that he was when he wrestled with Philomeleides in</p>
<p>Lesbos,</p>
<p>and threw him so heavily that all the Achaeans cheered him‚Äîif</p>
<p>he is still such and were to come near these suitors,</p>
<p>they would have a</p>
<p>short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your questions,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>will not prevaricate nor deceive you,</p>
<p>but will tell you without</p>
<p>concealment all that the old man of the sea told me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was trying to come on here,</p>
<p>but the gods detained me in Egypt,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>my hecatombs had not given them full satisfaction,</p>
<p>and the gods are</p>
<p>very strict about having their dues. Now off Egypt,</p>
<p>about as far as a</p>
<p>ship can sail in a day with a good stiff breeze behind her,</p>
<p>there is an</p>
<p>island called Pharos‚Äîit has a good harbour from which vessels can get</p>
<p>out into open sea when they have taken in water‚Äîand here the gods</p>
<p>becalmed me twenty days without so much as a breath of fair wind to</p>
<p>help me forward. We should have run clean out of provisions and my men</p>
<p>would have starved,</p>
<p>if a goddess had not taken pity upon me and saved</p>
<p>me in the person of Idothea,</p>
<p>daughter to Proteus,</p>
<p>the old man of the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>for she had taken a great fancy to me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe came to me one day when I was by myself,</p>
<p>as I often was,</p>
<p>for the</p>
<p>men used to go with their barbed hooks,</p>
<p>all over the island in the hope</p>
<p>of catching a fish or two to save them from the pangs of hunger.</p>
<p>‚ÄòStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äô said she,</p>
<p>‚Äòit seems to me that you like starving in this</p>
<p>way‚Äîat any rate it does not greatly trouble you,</p>
<p>for you stick here day</p>
<p>after day,</p>
<p>without even trying to get away though your men are dying by</p>
<p>inches.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòLet me tell you,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòwhichever of the goddesses you may happen</p>
<p>to be,</p>
<p>that I am not staying here of my own accord,</p>
<p>but must have</p>
<p>offended the gods that live in heaven. Tell me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>for the gods</p>
<p>know everything,</p>
<p>which of the immortals it is that is hindering me in</p>
<p>this way,</p>
<p>and tell me also how I may sail the sea so as to reach my</p>
<p>home.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äô replied she,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI will make it all quite clear to you. There</p>
<p>is an old immortal who lives under the sea hereabouts and whose name is</p>
<p>Proteus. He is an Egyptian,</p>
<p>and people say he is my father; he is</p>
<p>Neptune‚Äôs head man and knows every inch of ground all over the bottom</p>
<p>of the sea. If you can snare him and hold him tight,</p>
<p>he will tell you</p>
<p>about your voyage,</p>
<p>what courses you are to take,</p>
<p>and how you are to</p>
<p>sail the sea so as to reach your home. He will also tell you,</p>
<p>if you so</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>all that has been going on at your house both good and bad,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>you have been away on your long and dangerous journey.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòCan you show me,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòsome stratagem by means of which I may</p>
<p>catch this old god without his suspecting it and finding me out? For a</p>
<p>god is not easily caught‚Äînot by a mortal man.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äô said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI will make it all quite clear to you. About</p>
<p>the time when the sun shall have reached mid heaven,</p>
<p>the old man of the</p>
<p>sea comes up from under the waves,</p>
<p>heralded by the West wind that furs</p>
<p>the water over his head. As soon as he has come up he lies down,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>goes to sleep in a great sea cave,</p>
<p>where the seals‚ÄîHalosydne‚Äôs chickens</p>
<p>as they call them‚Äîcome up also from the grey sea,</p>
<p>and go to sleep in</p>
<p>shoals all round him; and a very strong and fish-like smell do they</p>
<p>bring with them. 44 Early to-morrow morning I will take you to this</p>
<p>place and will lay you in ambush. Pick out,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>the three best</p>
<p>men you have in your fleet,</p>
<p>and I will tell you all the tricks that the</p>
<p>old man will play you.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòFirst he will look over all his seals,</p>
<p>and count them; then,</p>
<p>when he</p>
<p>has seen them and tallied them on his five fingers,</p>
<p>he will go to sleep</p>
<p>among them,</p>
<p>as a shepherd among his sheep. The moment you see that he</p>
<p>is asleep seize him; put forth all your strength and hold him fast,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he will do his very utmost to get away from you. He will turn himself</p>
<p>into every kind of creature that goes upon the earth,</p>
<p>and will become</p>
<p>also both fire and water; but you must hold him fast and grip him</p>
<p>tighter and tighter,</p>
<p>till he begins to talk to you and comes back to</p>
<p>what he was when you saw him go to sleep; then you may slacken your</p>
<p>hold and let him go; and you can ask him which of the gods it is that</p>
<p>is angry with you,</p>
<p>and what you must do to reach your home over the</p>
<p>seas.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHaving so said she dived under the waves,</p>
<p>whereon I turned back to the</p>
<p>place where my ships were ranged upon the shore; and my heart was</p>
<p>clouded with care as I went along. When I reached my ship we got supper</p>
<p>ready,</p>
<p>for night was falling,</p>
<p>and camped down upon the beach.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>I took the</p>
<p>three men on whose prowess of all kinds I could most rely,</p>
<p>and went</p>
<p>along by the sea-side,</p>
<p>praying heartily to heaven. Meanwhile the</p>
<p>goddess fetched me up four seal skins from the bottom of the sea,</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>of them just skinned,</p>
<p>for she meant playing a trick upon her father.</p>
<p>Then she dug four pits for us to lie in,</p>
<p>and sat down to wait till we</p>
<p>should come up. When we were close to her,</p>
<p>she made us lie down in the</p>
<p>pits one after the other,</p>
<p>and threw a seal skin over each of us. Our</p>
<p>ambuscade would have been intolerable,</p>
<p>for the stench of the fishy</p>
<p>seals was most distressing45‚Äîwho would go to bed with a sea monster if</p>
<p>he could help it?‚Äîbut here,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>the goddess helped us,</p>
<p>and thought of</p>
<p>something that gave us great relief,</p>
<p>for she put some ambrosia under</p>
<p>each man‚Äôs nostrils,</p>
<p>which was so fragrant that it killed the smell of</p>
<p>the seals.46</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe waited the whole morning and made the best of it,</p>
<p>watching the</p>
<p>seals come up in hundreds to bask upon the sea shore,</p>
<p>till at noon the</p>
<p>old man of the sea came up too,</p>
<p>and when he had found his fat seals he</p>
<p>went over them and counted them. We were among the first he counted,</p>
<p>and he never suspected any guile,</p>
<p>but laid himself down to sleep as</p>
<p>soon as he had done counting. Then we rushed upon him with a shout and</p>
<p>seized him; on which he began at once with his old tricks,</p>
<p>and changed</p>
<p>himself first into a lion with a great mane; then all of a sudden he</p>
<p>became a dragon,</p>
<p>a leopard,</p>
<p>a wild boar; the next moment he was running</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>and then again directly he was a tree,</p>
<p>but we stuck to him and</p>
<p>never lost hold,</p>
<p>till at last the cunning old creature became</p>
<p>distressed,</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWhich of the gods was it,</p>
<p>Son of Atreus,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>hatched this plot with you for snaring me and seizing me against my</p>
<p>will? What do you want?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou know that yourself,</p>
<p>old man,</p>
<p>‚Äô I answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòyou will gain nothing</p>
<p>by trying to put me off. It is because I have been kept so long in this</p>
<p>island,</p>
<p>and see no sign of my being able to get away. I am losing all</p>
<p>heart; tell me,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>for you gods know everything,</p>
<p>which of the</p>
<p>immortals it is that is hindering me,</p>
<p>and tell me also how I may sail</p>
<p>the sea so as to reach my home?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,</p>
<p>‚Äô he said,</p>
<p>‚Äòif you would finish your voyage and get home quickly,</p>
<p>you must offer sacrifices to Jove and to the rest of the gods before</p>
<p>embarking; for it is decreed that you shall not get back to your</p>
<p>friends,</p>
<p>and to your own house,</p>
<p>till you have returned to the</p>
<p>heaven-fed stream of Egypt,</p>
<p>and offered holy hecatombs to the immortal</p>
<p>gods that reign in heaven. When you have done this they will let you</p>
<p>finish your voyage.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was broken hearted when I heard that I must go back all that long</p>
<p>and terrible voyage to Egypt;47 nevertheless,</p>
<p>I answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI will do</p>
<p>all,</p>
<p>old man,</p>
<p>that you have laid upon me; but now tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me</p>
<p>true,</p>
<p>whether all the Achaeans whom Nestor and I left behind us when we</p>
<p>set sail from Troy have got home safely,</p>
<p>or whether any one of them</p>
<p>came to a bad end either on board his own ship or among his friends</p>
<p>when the days of his fighting were done.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòSon of Atreus,</p>
<p>‚Äô he answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòwhy ask me? You had better not know</p>
<p>what I can tell you,</p>
<p>for your eyes will surely fill when you have heard</p>
<p>my story. Many of those about whom you ask are dead and gone,</p>
<p>but many</p>
<p>still remain,</p>
<p>and only two of the chief men among the Achaeans perished</p>
<p>during their return home. As for what happened on the field of</p>
<p>battle‚Äîyou were there yourself. A third Achaean leader is still at sea,</p>
<p>alive,</p>
<p>but hindered from returning. Ajax was wrecked,</p>
<p>for Neptune drove</p>
<p>him on to the great rocks of Gyrae; nevertheless,</p>
<p>he let him get safe</p>
<p>out of the water,</p>
<p>and in spite of all Minerva‚Äôs hatred he would have</p>
<p>escaped death,</p>
<p>if he had not ruined himself by boasting. He said the</p>
<p>gods could not drown him even though they had tried to do so,</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>Neptune heard this large talk,</p>
<p>he seized his trident in his two brawny</p>
<p>hands,</p>
<p>and split the rock of Gyrae in two pieces. The base remained</p>
<p>where it was,</p>
<p>but the part on which Ajax was sitting fell headlong into</p>
<p>the sea and carried Ajax with it; so he drank salt water and was</p>
<p>drowned.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYour brother and his ships escaped,</p>
<p>for Juno protected him,</p>
<p>but when</p>
<p>he was just about to reach the high promontory of Malea,</p>
<p>he was caught</p>
<p>by a heavy gale which carried him out to sea again sorely against his</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>and drove him to the foreland where Thyestes used to dwell,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>where Aegisthus was then living. By and by,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>it seemed as</p>
<p>though he was to return safely after all,</p>
<p>for the gods backed the wind</p>
<p>into its old quarter and they reached home; whereon Agamemnon kissed</p>
<p>his native soil,</p>
<p>and shed tears of joy at finding himself in his own</p>
<p>country.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòNow there was a watchman whom Aegisthus kept always on the watch,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>to whom he had promised two talents of gold. This man had been looking</p>
<p>out for a whole year to make sure that Agamemnon did not give him the</p>
<p>slip and prepare war; when,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>this man saw Agamemnon go by,</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>went and told Aegisthus,</p>
<p>who at once began to lay a plot for him. He</p>
<p>picked twenty of his bravest warriors and placed them in ambuscade on</p>
<p>one side the cloister,</p>
<p>while on the opposite side he prepared a</p>
<p>banquet. Then he sent his chariots and horsemen to Agamemnon,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>invited him to the feast,</p>
<p>but he meant foul play. He got him there,</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>unsuspicious of the doom that was awaiting him,</p>
<p>and killed him when the</p>
<p>banquet was over as though he were butchering an ox in the shambles;</p>
<p>not one of Agamemnon‚Äôs followers was left alive,</p>
<p>nor yet one of</p>
<p>Aegisthus‚Äô,</p>
<p>but they were all killed there in the cloisters.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus spoke Proteus,</p>
<p>and I was broken hearted as I heard him. I sat</p>
<p>down upon the sands and wept; I felt as though I could no longer bear</p>
<p>to live nor look upon the light of the sun. Presently,</p>
<p>when I had had</p>
<p>my fill of weeping and writhing upon the ground,</p>
<p>the old man of the sea</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSon of Atreus,</p>
<p>do not waste any more time in crying so bitterly;</p>
<p>it can do no manner of good; find your way home as fast as ever you</p>
<p>can,</p>
<p>for Aegisthus may be still alive,</p>
<p>and even though Orestes has been</p>
<p>beforehand with you in killing him,</p>
<p>you may yet come in for his</p>
<p>funeral.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this I took comfort in spite of all my sorrow,</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI know,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>about these two; tell me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>about the third man of whom</p>
<p>you spoke; is he still alive,</p>
<p>but at sea,</p>
<p>and unable to get home? or is</p>
<p>he dead? Tell me,</p>
<p>no matter how much it may grieve me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòThe third man,</p>
<p>‚Äô he answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòis Ulysses who dwells in Ithaca. I can</p>
<p>see him in an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the nymph</p>
<p>Calypso,</p>
<p>who is keeping him prisoner,</p>
<p>and he cannot reach his home for</p>
<p>he has no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea. As for your own</p>
<p>end,</p>
<p>Menelaus,</p>
<p>you shall not die in Argos,</p>
<p>but the gods will take you</p>
<p>to the Elysian plain,</p>
<p>which is at the ends of the world. There</p>
<p>fair-haired Rhadamanthus reigns,</p>
<p>and men lead an easier life than any</p>
<p>where else in the world,</p>
<p>for in Elysium there falls not rain,</p>
<p>nor hail,</p>
<p>nor snow,</p>
<p>but Oceanus breathes ever with a West wind that sings softly</p>
<p>from the sea,</p>
<p>and gives fresh life to all men. This will happen to you</p>
<p>because you have married Helen,</p>
<p>and are Jove‚Äôs son-in-law.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs he spoke he dived under the waves,</p>
<p>whereon I turned back to the</p>
<p>ships with my companions,</p>
<p>and my heart was clouded with care as I went</p>
<p>along. When we reached the ships we got supper ready,</p>
<p>for night was</p>
<p>falling,</p>
<p>and camped down upon the beach. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>we drew our ships into the water,</p>
<p>and put</p>
<p>our masts and sails within them; then we went on board ourselves,</p>
<p>took</p>
<p>our seats on the benches,</p>
<p>and smote the grey sea with our oars. I again</p>
<p>stationed my ships in the heaven-fed stream of Egypt,</p>
<p>and offered</p>
<p>hecatombs that were full and sufficient. When I had thus appeased</p>
<p>heaven‚Äôs anger,</p>
<p>I raised a barrow to the memory of Agamemnon that his</p>
<p>name might live for ever,</p>
<p>after which I had a quick passage home,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>the gods sent me a fair wind.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd now for yourself‚Äîstay here some ten or twelve days longer,</p>
<p>and I</p>
<p>will then speed you on your way. I will make you a noble present of a</p>
<p>chariot and three horses. I will also give you a beautiful chalice that</p>
<p>so long as you live you may think of me whenever you make a</p>
<p>drink-offering to the immortal gods.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSon of Atreus,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not press me to stay longer; I</p>
<p>should be contented to remain with you for another twelve months; I</p>
<p>find your conversation so delightful that I should never once wish</p>
<p>myself at home with my parents; but my crew whom I have left at Pylos</p>
<p>are already impatient,</p>
<p>and you are detaining me from them. As for any</p>
<p>present you may be disposed to make me,</p>
<p>I had rather that it should be</p>
<p>a piece of plate. I will take no horses back with me to Ithaca,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>will leave them to adorn your own stables,</p>
<p>for you have much flat</p>
<p>ground in your kingdom where lotus thrives,</p>
<p>as also meadow-sweet and</p>
<p>wheat and barley,</p>
<p>and oats with their white and spreading ears; whereas</p>
<p>in Ithaca we have neither open fields nor racecourses,</p>
<p>and the country</p>
<p>is more fit for goats than horses,</p>
<p>and I like it the better for that.</p>
<p>48 None of our islands have much level ground,</p>
<p>suitable for horses,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Ithaca least of all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus smiled and took Telemachus‚Äôs hand within his own. ‚ÄúWhat you</p>
<p>say,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúshows that you come of good family. I both can,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>make this exchange for you,</p>
<p>by giving you the finest and most</p>
<p>precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a mixing bowl by</p>
<p>Vulcan‚Äôs own hand,</p>
<p>of pure silver,</p>
<p>except the rim,</p>
<p>which is inlaid with</p>
<p>gold. Phaedimus,</p>
<p>king of the Sidonians,</p>
<p>gave it me in the course of a</p>
<p>visit which I paid him when I returned thither on my homeward journey.</p>
<p>I will make you a present of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse [and guests kept coming to the king‚Äôs house.</p>
<p>They brought sheep and wine,</p>
<p>while their wives had put up bread for</p>
<p>them to take with them; so they were busy cooking their dinners in the</p>
<p>courts].49</p>
<p>Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs or aiming with spears at a</p>
<p>mark on the levelled ground in front of Ulysses‚Äô house,</p>
<p>and were</p>
<p>behaving with all their old insolence. Antinous and Eurymachus,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>were their ringleaders and much the foremost among them all,</p>
<p>were</p>
<p>sitting together when Noemon son of Phronius came up and said to</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHave we any idea,</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>on what day Telemachus returns from Pylos?</p>
<p>He has a ship of mine,</p>
<p>and I want it,</p>
<p>to cross over to Elis: I have</p>
<p>twelve brood mares there with yearling mule foals by their side not yet</p>
<p>broken in,</p>
<p>and I want to bring one of them over here and break him.‚Äù</p>
<p>They were astounded when they heard this,</p>
<p>for they had made sure that</p>
<p>Telemachus had not gone to the city of Neleus. They thought he was only</p>
<p>away somewhere on the farms,</p>
<p>and was with the sheep,</p>
<p>or with the</p>
<p>swineherd; so Antinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen did he go? Tell me truly,</p>
<p>and what</p>
<p>young men did he take with him? Were they freemen or his own</p>
<p>bondsmen‚Äîfor he might manage that too? Tell me also,</p>
<p>did you let him</p>
<p>have the ship of your own free will because he asked you,</p>
<p>or did he</p>
<p>take it without your leave?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI lent it him,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Noemon,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat else could I do when a man of</p>
<p>his position said he was in a difficulty,</p>
<p>and asked me to oblige him? I</p>
<p>could not possibly refuse. As for those who went with him they were the</p>
<p>best young men we have,</p>
<p>and I saw Mentor go on board as captain‚Äîor some</p>
<p>god who was exactly like him. I cannot understand it,</p>
<p>for I saw Mentor</p>
<p>here myself yesterday morning,</p>
<p>and yet he was then setting out for</p>
<p>Pylos.‚Äù</p>
<p>Noemon then went back to his father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>but Antinous and</p>
<p>Eurymachus were very angry. They told the others to leave off playing,</p>
<p>and to come and sit down along with themselves. When they came,</p>
<p>Antinous son of Eupeithes spoke in anger. His heart was black with</p>
<p>rage,</p>
<p>and his eyes flashed fire as he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood heavens,</p>
<p>this voyage of Telemachus is a very serious matter; we</p>
<p>had made sure that it would come to nothing,</p>
<p>but the young fellow has</p>
<p>got away in spite of us,</p>
<p>and with a picked crew too. He will be giving</p>
<p>us trouble presently; may Jove take him before he is full grown. Find</p>
<p>me a ship,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>with a crew of twenty men,</p>
<p>and I will lie in wait</p>
<p>for him in the straits between Ithaca and Samos; he will then rue the</p>
<p>day that he set out to try and get news of his father.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and the others applauded his saying; they then all</p>
<p>of them went inside the buildings.</p>
<p>It was not long ere Penelope came to know what the suitors were</p>
<p>plotting; for a man servant,</p>
<p>Medon,</p>
<p>overheard them from outside the</p>
<p>outer court as they were laying their schemes within,</p>
<p>and went to tell</p>
<p>his mistress. As he crossed the threshold of her room Penelope said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMedon,</p>
<p>what have the suitors sent you here for? Is it to tell the</p>
<p>maids to leave their master‚Äôs business and cook dinner for them? I wish</p>
<p>they may neither woo nor dine henceforward,</p>
<p>neither here nor anywhere</p>
<p>else,</p>
<p>but let this be the very last time,</p>
<p>for the waste you all make of</p>
<p>my son‚Äôs estate. Did not your fathers tell you when you were children,</p>
<p>how good Ulysses had been to them‚Äînever doing anything high-handed,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>speaking harshly to anybody? Kings may say things sometimes,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>may take a fancy to one man and dislike another,</p>
<p>but Ulysses never did</p>
<p>an unjust thing by anybody‚Äîwhich shows what bad hearts you have,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>that there is no such thing as gratitude left in this world.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Medon said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>that this were all; but they are</p>
<p>plotting something much more dreadful now‚Äîmay heaven frustrate their</p>
<p>design. They are going to try and murder Telemachus as he is coming</p>
<p>home from Pylos and Lacedaemon,</p>
<p>where he has been to get news of his</p>
<p>father.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Penelope‚Äôs heart sank within her,</p>
<p>and for a long time she was</p>
<p>speechless; her eyes filled with tears,</p>
<p>and she could find no</p>
<p>utterance. At last,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>she said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy did my son leave me? What</p>
<p>business had he to go sailing off in ships that make long voyages over</p>
<p>the ocean like sea-horses? Does he want to die without leaving any one</p>
<p>behind him to keep up his name?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI do not know,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Medon,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhether some god set him on to it,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>whether he went on his own impulse to see if he could find out if his</p>
<p>father was dead,</p>
<p>or alive and on his way home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he went downstairs again,</p>
<p>leaving Penelope in an agony of grief.</p>
<p>There were plenty of seats in the house,</p>
<p>but she had no heart for</p>
<p>sitting on any one of them; she could only fling herself on the floor</p>
<p>of her own room and cry; whereon all the maids in the house,</p>
<p>both old</p>
<p>and young,</p>
<p>gathered round her and began to cry too,</p>
<p>till at last in a</p>
<p>transport of sorrow she exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dears,</p>
<p>heaven has been pleased to try me with more affliction than</p>
<p>any other woman of my age and country. First I lost my brave and</p>
<p>lion-hearted husband,</p>
<p>who had every good quality under heaven,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>whose name was great over all Hellas and middle Argos,</p>
<p>and now my</p>
<p>darling son is at the mercy of the winds and waves,</p>
<p>without my having</p>
<p>heard one word about his leaving home. You hussies,</p>
<p>there was not one</p>
<p>of you would so much as think of giving me a call out of my bed,</p>
<p>though</p>
<p>you all of you very well knew when he was starting. If I had known he</p>
<p>meant taking this voyage,</p>
<p>he would have had to give it up,</p>
<p>no matter</p>
<p>how much he was bent upon it,</p>
<p>or leave me a corpse behind him‚Äîone or</p>
<p>other. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>go some of you and call old Dolius,</p>
<p>who was given</p>
<p>me by my father on my marriage,</p>
<p>and who is my gardener. Bid him go at</p>
<p>once and tell everything to Laertes,</p>
<p>who may be able to hit on some</p>
<p>plan for enlisting public sympathy on our side,</p>
<p>as against those who</p>
<p>are trying to exterminate his own race and that of Ulysses.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then the dear old nurse Euryclea said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou may kill me,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>or let</p>
<p>me live on in your house,</p>
<p>whichever you please,</p>
<p>but I will tell you the</p>
<p>real truth. I knew all about it,</p>
<p>and gave him everything he wanted in</p>
<p>the way of bread and wine,</p>
<p>but he made me take my solemn oath that I</p>
<p>would not tell you anything for some ten or twelve days,</p>
<p>unless you</p>
<p>asked or happened to hear of his having gone,</p>
<p>for he did not want you</p>
<p>to spoil your beauty by crying. And now,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>wash your face,</p>
<p>change</p>
<p>your dress,</p>
<p>and go upstairs with your maids to offer prayers to</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>daughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,</p>
<p>for she can save him even</p>
<p>though he be in the jaws of death. Do not trouble Laertes: he has</p>
<p>trouble enough already. Besides,</p>
<p>I cannot think that the gods hate the</p>
<p>race of the son of Arceisius so much,</p>
<p>but there will be a son left to</p>
<p>come up after him,</p>
<p>and inherit both the house and the fair fields that</p>
<p>lie far all round it.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words she made her mistress leave off crying,</p>
<p>and dried the</p>
<p>tears from her eyes. Penelope washed her face,</p>
<p>changed her dress,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>went upstairs with her maids. She then put some bruised barley into a</p>
<p>basket and began praying to Minerva.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>‚Äù she cried,</p>
<p>‚ÄúDaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,</p>
<p>unweariable. If</p>
<p>ever Ulysses while he was here burned you fat thigh bones of sheep or</p>
<p>heifer,</p>
<p>bear it in mind now as in my favour,</p>
<p>and save my darling son</p>
<p>from the villainy of the suitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>She cried aloud as she spoke,</p>
<p>and the goddess heard her prayer;</p>
<p>meanwhile the suitors were clamorous throughout the covered cloister,</p>
<p>and one of them said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe queen is preparing for her marriage with one or other of us.</p>
<p>Little does she dream that her son has now been doomed to die.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was what they said,</p>
<p>but they did not know what was going to</p>
<p>happen. Then Antinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúComrades,</p>
<p>let there be no loud talking,</p>
<p>lest some of it get carried inside. Let us be up and do that in</p>
<p>silence,</p>
<p>about which we are all of a mind.‚Äù</p>
<p>He then chose twenty men,</p>
<p>and they went down to their ship and to the</p>
<p>sea side; they drew the vessel into the water and got her mast and</p>
<p>sails inside her; they bound the oars to the thole-pins with twisted</p>
<p>thongs of leather,</p>
<p>all in due course,</p>
<p>and spread the white sails aloft,</p>
<p>while their fine servants brought them their armour. Then they made the</p>
<p>ship fast a little way out,</p>
<p>came on shore again,</p>
<p>got their suppers,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>waited till night should fall.</p>
<p>But Penelope lay in her own room upstairs unable to eat or drink,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>wondering whether her brave son would escape,</p>
<p>or be overpowered by the</p>
<p>wicked suitors. Like a lioness caught in the toils with huntsmen</p>
<p>hemming her in on every side she thought and thought till she sank into</p>
<p>a slumber,</p>
<p>and lay on her bed bereft of thought and motion.</p>
<p>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter,</p>
<p>and made a vision in the</p>
<p>likeness of Penelope‚Äôs sister Iphthime daughter of Icarius who had</p>
<p>married Eumelus and lived in Pherae. She told the vision to go to the</p>
<p>house of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and to make Penelope leave off crying,</p>
<p>so it came</p>
<p>into her room by the hole through which the thong went for pulling the</p>
<p>door to,</p>
<p>and hovered over her head saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are asleep,</p>
<p>Penelope: the gods who live at ease will not suffer</p>
<p>you to weep and be so sad. Your son has done them no wrong,</p>
<p>so he will</p>
<p>yet come back to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Penelope,</p>
<p>who was sleeping sweetly at the gates of dreamland,</p>
<p>answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSister,</p>
<p>why have you come here? You do not come very often,</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>suppose that is because you live such a long way off. Am I,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>leave off crying and refrain from all the sad thoughts that torture me?</p>
<p>I,</p>
<p>who have lost my brave and lion-hearted husband,</p>
<p>who had every good</p>
<p>quality under heaven,</p>
<p>and whose name was great over all Hellas and</p>
<p>middle Argos; and now my darling son has gone off on board of a ship‚Äîa</p>
<p>foolish fellow who has never been used to roughing it,</p>
<p>nor to going</p>
<p>about among gatherings of men. I am even more anxious about him than</p>
<p>about my husband; I am all in a tremble when I think of him,</p>
<p>lest</p>
<p>something should happen to him,</p>
<p>either from the people among whom he</p>
<p>has gone,</p>
<p>or by sea,</p>
<p>for he has many enemies who are plotting against</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>and are bent on killing him before he can return home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then the vision said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake heart,</p>
<p>and be not so much dismayed. There</p>
<p>is one gone with him whom many a man would be glad enough to have stand</p>
<p>by his side,</p>
<p>I mean Minerva; it is she who has compassion upon you,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>who has sent me to bear you this message.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúif you are a god or have been sent here by</p>
<p>divine commission,</p>
<p>tell me also about that other unhappy one‚Äîis he</p>
<p>still alive,</p>
<p>or is he already dead and in the house of Hades?‚Äù</p>
<p>And the vision said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI shall not tell you for certain whether he is</p>
<p>alive or dead,</p>
<p>and there is no use in idle conversation.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then it vanished through the thong-hole of the door and was dissipated</p>
<p>into thin air; but Penelope rose from her sleep refreshed and</p>
<p>comforted,</p>
<p>so vivid had been her dream.</p>
<p>Meantime the suitors went on board and sailed their ways over the sea,</p>
<p>intent on murdering Telemachus. Now there is a rocky islet called</p>
<p>Asteris,</p>
<p>of no great size,</p>
<p>in mid channel between Ithaca and Samos,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>there is a harbour on either side of it where a ship can lie. Here then</p>
<p>the Achaeans placed themselves in ambush.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK V</span>
<p>CALYPSO‚ÄîULYSSES REACHES SCHERIA ON A RAFT.</p>
<p>And now,</p>
<p>as Dawn rose from her couch beside Tithonus‚Äîharbinger of light</p>
<p>alike to mortals and immortals‚Äîthe gods met in council and with them,</p>
<p>Jove the lord of thunder,</p>
<p>who is their king. Thereon Minerva began to</p>
<p>tell them of the many sufferings of Ulysses,</p>
<p>for she pitied him away</p>
<p>there in the house of the nymph Calypso.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúand all you other gods that live in</p>
<p>everlasting bliss,</p>
<p>I hope there may never be such a thing as a kind and</p>
<p>well-disposed ruler any more,</p>
<p>nor one who will govern equitably. I hope</p>
<p>they will be all henceforth cruel and unjust,</p>
<p>for there is not one of</p>
<p>his subjects but has forgotten Ulysses,</p>
<p>who ruled them as though he</p>
<p>were their father. There he is,</p>
<p>lying in great pain in an island where</p>
<p>dwells the nymph Calypso,</p>
<p>who will not let him go; and he cannot get</p>
<p>back to his own country,</p>
<p>for he can find neither ships nor sailors to</p>
<p>take him over the sea. Furthermore,</p>
<p>wicked people are now trying to</p>
<p>murder his only son Telemachus,</p>
<p>who is coming home from Pylos and</p>
<p>Lacedaemon,</p>
<p>where he has been to see if he can get news of his father.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat,</p>
<p>my dear,</p>
<p>are you talking about?‚Äù replied her father,</p>
<p>‚Äúdid you</p>
<p>not send him there yourself,</p>
<p>because you thought it would help Ulysses</p>
<p>to get home and punish the suitors? Besides,</p>
<p>you are perfectly able to</p>
<p>protect Telemachus,</p>
<p>and to see him safely home again,</p>
<p>while the suitors</p>
<p>have to come hurry-skurrying back without having killed him.‚Äù</p>
<p>When he had thus spoken,</p>
<p>he said to his son Mercury,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMercury,</p>
<p>you are</p>
<p>our messenger,</p>
<p>go therefore and tell Calypso we have decreed that poor</p>
<p>Ulysses is to return home. He is to be convoyed neither by gods nor</p>
<p>men,</p>
<p>but after a perilous voyage of twenty days upon a raft he is to</p>
<p>reach fertile Scheria,</p>
<p>50 the land of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>who are near of</p>
<p>kin to the gods,</p>
<p>and will honour him as though he were one of</p>
<p>ourselves. They will send him in a ship to his own country,</p>
<p>and will</p>
<p>give him more bronze and gold and raiment than he would have brought</p>
<p>back from Troy,</p>
<p>if he had had all his prize money and had got home</p>
<p>without disaster. This is how we have settled that he shall return to</p>
<p>his country and his friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus he spoke,</p>
<p>and Mercury,</p>
<p>guide and guardian,</p>
<p>slayer of Argus,</p>
<p>did as</p>
<p>he was told. Forthwith he bound on his glittering golden sandals with</p>
<p>which he could fly like the wind over land and sea. He took the wand</p>
<p>with which he seals men‚Äôs eyes in sleep or wakes them just as he</p>
<p>pleases,</p>
<p>and flew holding it in his hand over Pieria; then he swooped</p>
<p>down through the firmament till he reached the level of the sea,</p>
<p>whose</p>
<p>waves he skimmed like a cormorant that flies fishing every hole and</p>
<p>corner of the ocean,</p>
<p>and drenching its thick plumage in the spray. He</p>
<p>flew and flew over many a weary wave,</p>
<p>but when at last he got to the</p>
<p>island which was his journey‚Äôs end,</p>
<p>he left the sea and went on by land</p>
<p>till he came to the cave where the nymph Calypso lived.</p>
<p>He found her at home. There was a large fire burning on the hearth,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>one could smell from far the fragrant reek of burning cedar and sandal</p>
<p>wood. As for herself,</p>
<p>she was busy at her loom,</p>
<p>shooting her golden</p>
<p>shuttle through the warp and singing beautifully. Round her cave there</p>
<p>was a thick wood of alder,</p>
<p>poplar,</p>
<p>and sweet smelling cypress trees,</p>
<p>wherein all kinds of great birds had built their nests‚Äîowls,</p>
<p>hawks,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>chattering sea-crows that occupy their business in the waters. A vine</p>
<p>loaded with grapes was trained and grew luxuriantly about the mouth of</p>
<p>the cave; there were also four running rills of water in channels cut</p>
<p>pretty close together,</p>
<p>and turned hither and thither so as to irrigate</p>
<p>the beds of violets and luscious herbage over which they flowed. 51</p>
<p>Even a god could not help being charmed with such a lovely spot,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>Mercury stood still and looked at it; but when he had admired it</p>
<p>sufficiently he went inside the cave.</p>
<p>Calypso knew him at once‚Äîfor the gods all know each other,</p>
<p>no matter</p>
<p>how far they live from one another‚Äîbut Ulysses was not within; he was</p>
<p>on the sea-shore as usual,</p>
<p>looking out upon the barren ocean with tears</p>
<p>in his eyes,</p>
<p>groaning and breaking his heart for sorrow. Calypso gave</p>
<p>Mercury a seat and said: ‚ÄúWhy have you come to see me,</p>
<p>Mercury‚Äîhonoured,</p>
<p>and ever welcome‚Äîfor you do not visit me often? Say</p>
<p>what you want; I will do it for you at once if I can,</p>
<p>and if it can be</p>
<p>done at all; but come inside,</p>
<p>and let me set refreshment before you.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke she drew a table loaded with ambrosia beside him and mixed</p>
<p>him some red nectar,</p>
<p>so Mercury ate and drank till he had had enough,</p>
<p>and then said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe are speaking god and goddess to one another,</p>
<p>and you ask me why I</p>
<p>have come here,</p>
<p>and I will tell you truly as you would have me do. Jove</p>
<p>sent me; it was no doing of mine; who could possibly want to come all</p>
<p>this way over the sea where there are no cities full of people to offer</p>
<p>me sacrifices or choice hecatombs? Nevertheless I had to come,</p>
<p>for none</p>
<p>of us other gods can cross Jove,</p>
<p>nor transgress his orders. He says</p>
<p>that you have here the most ill-starred of all those who fought nine</p>
<p>years before the city of King Priam and sailed home in the tenth year</p>
<p>after having sacked it. On their way home they sinned against</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>52 who raised both wind and waves against them,</p>
<p>so that all his</p>
<p>brave companions perished,</p>
<p>and he alone was carried hither by wind and</p>
<p>tide. Jove says that you are to let this man go at once,</p>
<p>for it is</p>
<p>decreed that he shall not perish here,</p>
<p>far from his own people,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>shall return to his house and country and see his friends again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Calypso trembled with rage when she heard this,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou gods,</p>
<p>‚Äù she</p>
<p>exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúought to be ashamed of yourselves. You are always jealous</p>
<p>and hate seeing a goddess take a fancy to a mortal man,</p>
<p>and live with</p>
<p>him in open matrimony. So when rosy-fingered Dawn made love to Orion,</p>
<p>you precious gods were all of you furious till Diana went and killed</p>
<p>him in Ortygia. So again when Ceres fell in love with Iasion,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>yielded to him in a thrice-ploughed fallow field,</p>
<p>Jove came to hear of</p>
<p>it before so very long and killed Iasion with his thunderbolts. And now</p>
<p>you are angry with me too because I have a man here. I found the poor</p>
<p>creature sitting all alone astride of a keel,</p>
<p>for Jove had struck his</p>
<p>ship with lightning and sunk it in mid ocean,</p>
<p>so that all his crew were</p>
<p>drowned,</p>
<p>while he himself was driven by wind and waves on to my island.</p>
<p>I got fond of him and cherished him,</p>
<p>and had set my heart on making him</p>
<p>immortal,</p>
<p>so that he should never grow old all his days; still I cannot</p>
<p>cross Jove,</p>
<p>nor bring his counsels to nothing; therefore,</p>
<p>if he insists</p>
<p>upon it,</p>
<p>let the man go beyond the seas again; but I cannot send him</p>
<p>anywhere myself for I have neither ships nor men who can take him.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I will readily give him such advice,</p>
<p>in all good faith,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>will be likely to bring him safely to his own country.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen send him away,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Mercury,</p>
<p>‚Äúor Jove will be angry with you and</p>
<p>punish you‚Äù.</p>
<p>On this he took his leave,</p>
<p>and Calypso went out to look for Ulysses,</p>
<p>for she had heard Jove‚Äôs message. She found him sitting upon the beach</p>
<p>with his eyes ever filled with tears,</p>
<p>and dying of sheer home sickness;</p>
<p>for he had got tired of Calypso,</p>
<p>and though he was forced to sleep with</p>
<p>her in the cave by night,</p>
<p>it was she,</p>
<p>not he,</p>
<p>that would have it so. As</p>
<p>for the day time,</p>
<p>he spent it on the rocks and on the sea shore,</p>
<p>weeping,</p>
<p>crying aloud for his despair,</p>
<p>and always looking out upon the</p>
<p>sea. Calypso then went close up to him said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy poor fellow,</p>
<p>you shall not stay here grieving and fretting your</p>
<p>life out any longer. I am going to send you away of my own free will;</p>
<p>so go,</p>
<p>cut some beams of wood,</p>
<p>and make yourself a large raft with an</p>
<p>upper deck that it may carry you safely over the sea. I will put bread,</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>and water on board to save you from starving. I will also give</p>
<p>you clothes,</p>
<p>and will send you a fair wind to take you home,</p>
<p>if the</p>
<p>gods in heaven so will it‚Äîfor they know more about these things,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>can settle them better than I can.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses shuddered as he heard her. ‚ÄúNow goddess,</p>
<p>‚Äù he answered,</p>
<p>‚Äúthere</p>
<p>is something behind all this; you cannot be really meaning to help me</p>
<p>home when you bid me do such a dreadful thing as put to sea on a raft.</p>
<p>Not even a well found ship with a fair wind could venture on such a</p>
<p>distant voyage: nothing that you can say or do shall make me go on</p>
<p>board a raft unless you first solemnly swear that you mean me no</p>
<p>mischief.‚Äù</p>
<p>Calypso smiled at this and caressed him with her hand: ‚ÄúYou know a</p>
<p>great deal,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúbut you are quite wrong here. May heaven above</p>
<p>and earth below be my witnesses,</p>
<p>with the waters of the river Styx‚Äîand</p>
<p>this is the most solemn oath which a blessed god can take‚Äîthat I mean</p>
<p>you no sort of harm,</p>
<p>and am only advising you to do exactly what I</p>
<p>should do myself in your place. I am dealing with you quite</p>
<p>straightforwardly; my heart is not made of iron,</p>
<p>and I am very sorry</p>
<p>for you.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she had thus spoken she led the way rapidly before him,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Ulysses followed in her steps; so the pair,</p>
<p>goddess and man,</p>
<p>went on</p>
<p>and on till they came to Calypso‚Äôs cave,</p>
<p>where Ulysses took the seat</p>
<p>that Mercury had just left. Calypso set meat and drink before him of</p>
<p>the food that mortals eat; but her maids brought ambrosia and nectar</p>
<p>for herself,</p>
<p>and they laid their hands on the good things that were</p>
<p>before them. When they had satisfied themselves with meat and drink,</p>
<p>Calypso spoke,</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>so you would start home to your own</p>
<p>land at once? Good luck go with you,</p>
<p>but if you could only know how</p>
<p>much suffering is in store for you before you get back to your own</p>
<p>country,</p>
<p>you would stay where you are,</p>
<p>keep house along with me,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>let me make you immortal,</p>
<p>no matter how anxious you may be to see this</p>
<p>wife of yours,</p>
<p>of whom you are thinking all the time day after day; yet</p>
<p>I flatter myself that I am no whit less tall or well-looking than she</p>
<p>is,</p>
<p>for it is not to be expected that a mortal woman should compare in</p>
<p>beauty with an immortal.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGoddess,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not be angry with me about this. I am</p>
<p>quite aware that my wife Penelope is nothing like so tall or so</p>
<p>beautiful as yourself. She is only a woman,</p>
<p>whereas you are an</p>
<p>immortal. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>I want to get home,</p>
<p>and can think of nothing</p>
<p>else. If some god wrecks me when I am on the sea,</p>
<p>I will bear it and</p>
<p>make the best of it. I have had infinite trouble both by land and sea</p>
<p>already,</p>
<p>so let this go with the rest.‚Äù</p>
<p>Presently the sun set and it became dark,</p>
<p>whereon the pair retired into</p>
<p>the inner part of the cave and went to bed.</p>
<p>When the child of morning rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>Ulysses put on</p>
<p>his shirt and cloak,</p>
<p>while the goddess wore a dress of a light gossamer</p>
<p>fabric,</p>
<p>very fine and graceful,</p>
<p>with a beautiful golden girdle about</p>
<p>her waist and a veil to cover her head. She at once set herself to</p>
<p>think how she could speed Ulysses on his way. So she gave him a great</p>
<p>bronze axe that suited his hands; it was sharpened on both sides,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>had a beautiful olive-wood handle fitted firmly on to it. She also gave</p>
<p>him a sharp adze,</p>
<p>and then led the way to the far end of the island</p>
<p>where the largest trees grew‚Äîalder,</p>
<p>poplar and pine,</p>
<p>that reached the</p>
<p>sky‚Äîvery dry and well seasoned,</p>
<p>so as to sail light for him in the</p>
<p>water.53 Then,</p>
<p>when she had shown him where the best trees grew,</p>
<p>Calypso went home,</p>
<p>leaving him to cut them,</p>
<p>which he soon finished</p>
<p>doing. He cut down twenty trees in all and adzed them smooth,</p>
<p>squaring</p>
<p>them by rule in good workmanlike fashion. Meanwhile Calypso came back</p>
<p>with some augers,</p>
<p>so he bored holes with them and fitted the timbers</p>
<p>together with bolts and rivets. He made the raft as broad as a skilled</p>
<p>shipwright makes the beam of a large vessel,</p>
<p>and he fixed a deck on top</p>
<p>of the ribs,</p>
<p>and ran a gunwale all round it. He also made a mast with a</p>
<p>yard arm,</p>
<p>and a rudder to steer with. He fenced the raft all round with</p>
<p>wicker hurdles as a protection against the waves,</p>
<p>and then he threw on</p>
<p>a quantity of wood. By and by Calypso brought him some linen to make</p>
<p>the sails,</p>
<p>and he made these too,</p>
<p>excellently,</p>
<p>making them fast with</p>
<p>braces and sheets. Last of all,</p>
<p>with the help of levers,</p>
<p>he drew the</p>
<p>raft down into the water.</p>
<p>In four days he had completed the whole work,</p>
<p>and on the fifth Calypso</p>
<p>sent him from the island after washing him and giving him some clean</p>
<p>clothes. She gave him a goat skin full of black wine,</p>
<p>and another</p>
<p>larger one of water; she also gave him a wallet full of provisions,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>found him in much good meat. Moreover,</p>
<p>she made the wind fair and warm</p>
<p>for him,</p>
<p>and gladly did Ulysses spread his sail before it,</p>
<p>while he sat</p>
<p>and guided the raft skilfully by means of the rudder. He never closed</p>
<p>his eyes,</p>
<p>but kept them fixed on the Pleiads,</p>
<p>on late-setting Bootes,</p>
<p>and on the Bear‚Äîwhich men also call the wain,</p>
<p>and which turns round and</p>
<p>round where it is,</p>
<p>facing Orion,</p>
<p>and alone never dipping into the</p>
<p>stream of Oceanus‚Äîfor Calypso had told him to keep this to his left.</p>
<p>Days seven and ten did he sail over the sea,</p>
<p>and on the eighteenth the</p>
<p>dim outlines of the mountains on the nearest part of the Phaeacian</p>
<p>coast appeared,</p>
<p>rising like a shield on the horizon.</p>
<p>But King Neptune,</p>
<p>who was returning from the Ethiopians,</p>
<p>caught sight</p>
<p>of Ulysses a long way off,</p>
<p>from the mountains of the Solymi. He could</p>
<p>see him sailing upon the sea,</p>
<p>and it made him very angry,</p>
<p>so he wagged</p>
<p>his head and muttered to himself,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood heavens,</p>
<p>so the gods</p>
<p>have been changing their minds about Ulysses while I was away in</p>
<p>Ethiopia,</p>
<p>and now he is close to the land of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>where it</p>
<p>is decreed that he shall escape from the calamities that have befallen</p>
<p>him. Still,</p>
<p>he shall have plenty of hardship yet before he has done</p>
<p>with it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thereon he gathered his clouds together,</p>
<p>grasped his trident,</p>
<p>stirred</p>
<p>it round in the sea,</p>
<p>and roused the rage of every wind that blows till</p>
<p>earth,</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>and sky were hidden in cloud,</p>
<p>and night sprang forth out of</p>
<p>the heavens. Winds from East,</p>
<p>South,</p>
<p>North,</p>
<p>and West fell upon him all</p>
<p>at the same time,</p>
<p>and a tremendous sea got up,</p>
<p>so that Ulysses‚Äô heart</p>
<p>began to fail him. ‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>‚Äù he said to himself in his dismay,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat ever</p>
<p>will become of me? I am afraid Calypso was right when she said I should</p>
<p>have trouble by sea before I got back home. It is all coming true. How</p>
<p>black is Jove making heaven with his clouds,</p>
<p>and what a sea the winds</p>
<p>are raising from every quarter at once. I am now safe to perish. Blest</p>
<p>and thrice blest were those Danaans who fell before Troy in the cause</p>
<p>of the sons of Atreus. Would that I had been killed on the day when the</p>
<p>Trojans were pressing me so sorely about the dead body of Achilles,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>then I should have had due burial and the Achaeans would have honoured</p>
<p>my name; but now it seems that I shall come to a most pitiable end.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke a sea broke over him with such terrific fury that the raft</p>
<p>reeled again,</p>
<p>and he was carried overboard a long way off. He let go</p>
<p>the helm,</p>
<p>and the force of the hurricane was so great that it broke the</p>
<p>mast half way up,</p>
<p>and both sail and yard went over into the sea. For a</p>
<p>long time Ulysses was under water,</p>
<p>and it was all he could do to rise</p>
<p>to the surface again,</p>
<p>for the clothes Calypso had given him weighed him</p>
<p>down; but at last he got his head above water and spat out the bitter</p>
<p>brine that was running down his face in streams. In spite of all this,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>he did not lose sight of his raft,</p>
<p>but swam as fast as he</p>
<p>could towards it,</p>
<p>got hold of it,</p>
<p>and climbed on board again so as to</p>
<p>escape drowning. The sea took the raft and tossed it about as Autumn</p>
<p>winds whirl thistledown round and round upon a road. It was as though</p>
<p>the South,</p>
<p>North,</p>
<p>East,</p>
<p>and West winds were all playing battledore and</p>
<p>shuttlecock with it at once.</p>
<p>When he was in this plight,</p>
<p>Ino daughter of Cadmus,</p>
<p>also called</p>
<p>Leucothea,</p>
<p>saw him. She had formerly been a mere mortal,</p>
<p>but had been</p>
<p>since raised to the rank of a marine goddess. Seeing in what great</p>
<p>distress Ulysses now was,</p>
<p>she had compassion upon him,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>rising like</p>
<p>a sea-gull from the waves,</p>
<p>took her seat upon the raft.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy poor good man,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhy is Neptune so furiously angry with</p>
<p>you? He is giving you a great deal of trouble,</p>
<p>but for all his bluster</p>
<p>he will not kill you. You seem to be a sensible person,</p>
<p>do then as I</p>
<p>bid you; strip,</p>
<p>leave your raft to drive before the wind,</p>
<p>and swim to</p>
<p>the Phaeacian coast where better luck awaits you. And here,</p>
<p>take my</p>
<p>veil and put it round your chest; it is enchanted,</p>
<p>and you can come to</p>
<p>no harm so long as you wear it. As soon as you touch land take it off,</p>
<p>throw it back as far as you can into the sea,</p>
<p>and then go away again.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words she took off her veil and gave it him. Then she dived</p>
<p>down again like a sea-gull and vanished beneath the dark blue waters.</p>
<p>But Ulysses did not know what to think. ‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>‚Äù he said to himself in</p>
<p>his dismay,</p>
<p>‚Äúthis is only some one or other of the gods who is luring</p>
<p>me to ruin by advising me to quit my raft. At any rate I will not do so</p>
<p>at present,</p>
<p>for the land where she said I should be quit of all</p>
<p>troubles seemed to be still a good way off. I know what I will do‚ÄîI am</p>
<p>sure it will be best‚Äîno matter what happens I will stick to the raft as</p>
<p>long as her timbers hold together,</p>
<p>but when the sea breaks her up I</p>
<p>will swim for it; I do not see how I can do any better than this.‚Äù</p>
<p>While he was thus in two minds,</p>
<p>Neptune sent a terrible great wave that</p>
<p>seemed to rear itself above his head till it broke right over the raft,</p>
<p>which then went to pieces as though it were a heap of dry chaff tossed</p>
<p>about by a whirlwind. Ulysses got astride of one plank and rode upon it</p>
<p>as if he were on horseback; he then took off the clothes Calypso had</p>
<p>given him,</p>
<p>bound Ino‚Äôs veil under his arms,</p>
<p>and plunged into the</p>
<p>sea‚Äîmeaning to swim on shore. King Neptune watched him as he did so,</p>
<p>and wagged his head,</p>
<p>muttering to himself and saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere now,</p>
<p>swim</p>
<p>up and down as you best can till you fall in with well-to-do people. I</p>
<p>do not think you will be able to say that I have let you off too</p>
<p>lightly.‚Äù On this he lashed his horses and drove to Aegae where his</p>
<p>palace is.</p>
<p>But Minerva resolved to help Ulysses,</p>
<p>so she bound the ways of all the</p>
<p>winds except one,</p>
<p>and made them lie quite still; but she roused a good</p>
<p>stiff breeze from the North that should lay the waters till Ulysses</p>
<p>reached the land of the Phaeacians where he would be safe.</p>
<p>Thereon he floated about for two nights and two days in the water,</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>a heavy swell on the sea and death staring him in the face; but when</p>
<p>the third day broke,</p>
<p>the wind fell and there was a dead calm without so</p>
<p>much as a breath of air stirring. As he rose on the swell he looked</p>
<p>eagerly ahead,</p>
<p>and could see land quite near. Then,</p>
<p>as children rejoice</p>
<p>when their dear father begins to get better after having for a long</p>
<p>time borne sore affliction sent him by some angry spirit,</p>
<p>but the gods</p>
<p>deliver him from evil,</p>
<p>so was Ulysses thankful when he again saw land</p>
<p>and trees,</p>
<p>and swam on with all his strength that he might once more</p>
<p>set foot upon dry ground. When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>he got within earshot,</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>began to hear the surf thundering up against the rocks,</p>
<p>for the swell</p>
<p>still broke against them with a terrific roar. Everything was enveloped</p>
<p>in spray; there were no harbours where a ship might ride,</p>
<p>nor shelter</p>
<p>of any kind,</p>
<p>but only headlands,</p>
<p>low-lying rocks,</p>
<p>and mountain tops.</p>
<p>Ulysses‚Äô heart now began to fail him,</p>
<p>and he said despairingly to</p>
<p>himself,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>Jove has let me see land after swimming so far that I</p>
<p>had given up all hope,</p>
<p>but I can find no landing place,</p>
<p>for the coast</p>
<p>is rocky and surf-beaten,</p>
<p>the rocks are smooth and rise sheer from the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>with deep water close under them so that I cannot climb out for</p>
<p>want of foot hold. I am afraid some great wave will lift me off my legs</p>
<p>and dash me against the rocks as I leave the water‚Äîwhich would give me</p>
<p>a sorry landing. If,</p>
<p>on the other hand,</p>
<p>I swim further in search of</p>
<p>some shelving beach or harbour,</p>
<p>a hurricane may carry me out to sea</p>
<p>again sorely against my will,</p>
<p>or heaven may send some great monster of</p>
<p>the deep to attack me; for Amphitrite breeds many such,</p>
<p>and I know that</p>
<p>Neptune is very angry with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>While he was thus in two minds a wave caught him and took him with such</p>
<p>force against the rocks that he would have been smashed and torn to</p>
<p>pieces if Minerva had not shown him what to do. He caught hold of the</p>
<p>rock with both hands and clung to it groaning with pain till the wave</p>
<p>retired,</p>
<p>so he was saved that time; but presently the wave came on</p>
<p>again and carried him back with it far into the sea‚Äîtearing his hands</p>
<p>as the suckers of a polypus are torn when some one plucks it from its</p>
<p>bed,</p>
<p>and the stones come up along with it‚Äîeven so did the rocks tear</p>
<p>the skin from his strong hands,</p>
<p>and then the wave drew him deep down</p>
<p>under the water.</p>
<p>Here poor Ulysses would have certainly perished even in spite of his</p>
<p>own destiny,</p>
<p>if Minerva had not helped him to keep his wits about him.</p>
<p>He swam seaward again,</p>
<p>beyond reach of the surf that was beating</p>
<p>against the land,</p>
<p>and at the same time he kept looking towards the</p>
<p>shore to see if he could find some haven,</p>
<p>or a spit that should take</p>
<p>the waves aslant. By and by,</p>
<p>as he swam on,</p>
<p>he came to the mouth of a</p>
<p>river,</p>
<p>and here he thought would be the best place,</p>
<p>for there were no</p>
<p>rocks,</p>
<p>and it afforded shelter from the wind. He felt that there was a</p>
<p>current,</p>
<p>so he prayed inwardly and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>O King,</p>
<p>whoever you may be,</p>
<p>and save me from the anger of the</p>
<p>sea-god Neptune,</p>
<p>for I approach you prayerfully. Any one who has lost</p>
<p>his way has at all times a claim even upon the gods,</p>
<p>wherefore in my</p>
<p>distress I draw near to your stream,</p>
<p>and cling to the knees of your</p>
<p>riverhood. Have mercy upon me,</p>
<p>O king,</p>
<p>for I declare myself your</p>
<p>suppliant.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then the god staid his stream and stilled the waves,</p>
<p>making all calm</p>
<p>before him,</p>
<p>and bringing him safely into the mouth of the river. Here</p>
<p>at last Ulysses‚Äô knees and strong hands failed him,</p>
<p>for the sea had</p>
<p>completely broken him. His body was all swollen,</p>
<p>and his mouth and</p>
<p>nostrils ran down like a river with sea-water,</p>
<p>so that he could neither</p>
<p>breathe nor speak,</p>
<p>and lay swooning from sheer exhaustion; presently,</p>
<p>when he had got his breath and came to himself again,</p>
<p>he took off the</p>
<p>scarf that Ino had given him and threw it back into the salt54 stream</p>
<p>of the river,</p>
<p>whereon Ino received it into her hands from the wave that</p>
<p>bore it towards her. Then he left the river,</p>
<p>laid himself down among</p>
<p>the rushes,</p>
<p>and kissed the bounteous earth.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried to himself in his dismay,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat ever will become of</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>and how is it all to end? If I stay here upon the river bed through</p>
<p>the long watches of the night,</p>
<p>I am so exhausted that the bitter cold</p>
<p>and damp may make an end of me‚Äîfor towards sunrise there will be a keen</p>
<p>wind blowing from off the river. If,</p>
<p>on the other hand,</p>
<p>I climb the</p>
<p>hill side,</p>
<p>find shelter in the woods,</p>
<p>and sleep in some thicket,</p>
<p>I may</p>
<p>escape the cold and have a good night‚Äôs rest,</p>
<p>but some savage beast may</p>
<p>take advantage of me and devour me.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the end he deemed it best to take to the woods,</p>
<p>and he found one</p>
<p>upon some high ground not far from the water. There he crept beneath</p>
<p>two shoots of olive that grew from a single stock‚Äîthe one an ungrafted</p>
<p>sucker,</p>
<p>while the other had been grafted. No wind,</p>
<p>however squally,</p>
<p>could break through the cover they afforded,</p>
<p>nor could the sun‚Äôs rays</p>
<p>pierce them,</p>
<p>nor the rain get through them,</p>
<p>so closely did they grow</p>
<p>into one another. Ulysses crept under these and began to make himself a</p>
<p>bed to lie on,</p>
<p>for there was a great litter of dead leaves lying</p>
<p>about‚Äîenough to make a covering for two or three men even in hard</p>
<p>winter weather. He was glad enough to see this,</p>
<p>so he laid himself down</p>
<p>and heaped the leaves all round him. Then,</p>
<p>as one who lives alone in</p>
<p>the country,</p>
<p>far from any neighbor,</p>
<p>hides a brand as fire-seed in the</p>
<p>ashes to save himself from having to get a light elsewhere,</p>
<p>even so did</p>
<p>Ulysses cover himself up with leaves; and Minerva shed a sweet sleep</p>
<p>upon his eyes,</p>
<p>closed his eyelids,</p>
<p>and made him lose all memories of</p>
<p>his sorrows.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK VI</span>
<p>THE MEETING BETWEEN NAUSICAA AND ULYSSES.</p>
<p>So here Ulysses slept,</p>
<p>overcome by sleep and toil; but Minerva went off</p>
<p>to the country and city of the Phaeacians‚Äîa people who used to live in</p>
<p>the fair town of Hypereia,</p>
<p>near the lawless Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes</p>
<p>were stronger than they and plundered them,</p>
<p>so their king Nausithous</p>
<p>moved them thence and settled them in Scheria,</p>
<p>far from all other</p>
<p>people. He surrounded the city with a wall,</p>
<p>built houses and temples,</p>
<p>and divided the lands among his people; but he was dead and gone to the</p>
<p>house of Hades,</p>
<p>and King Alcinous,</p>
<p>whose counsels were inspired of</p>
<p>heaven,</p>
<p>was now reigning. To his house,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>did Minerva hie in</p>
<p>furtherance of the return of Ulysses.</p>
<p>She went straight to the beautifully decorated bedroom in which there</p>
<p>slept a girl who was as lovely as a goddess,</p>
<p>Nausicaa,</p>
<p>daughter to King</p>
<p>Alcinous. Two maid servants were sleeping near her,</p>
<p>both very pretty,</p>
<p>one on either side of the doorway,</p>
<p>which was closed with well made</p>
<p>folding doors. Minerva took the form of the famous sea captain Dymas‚Äôs</p>
<p>daughter,</p>
<p>who was a bosom friend of Nausicaa and just her own age;</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>coming up to the girl‚Äôs bedside like a breath of wind,</p>
<p>she</p>
<p>hovered over her head and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúNausicaa,</p>
<p>what can your mother have been about,</p>
<p>to have such a lazy</p>
<p>daughter? Here are your clothes all lying in disorder,</p>
<p>yet you are</p>
<p>going to be married almost immediately,</p>
<p>and should not only be well</p>
<p>dressed yourself,</p>
<p>but should find good clothes for those who attend</p>
<p>you. This is the way to get yourself a good name,</p>
<p>and to make your</p>
<p>father and mother proud of you. Suppose,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>that we make tomorrow a</p>
<p>washing day,</p>
<p>and start at daybreak. I will come and help you so that</p>
<p>you may have everything ready as soon as possible,</p>
<p>for all the best</p>
<p>young men among your own people are courting you,</p>
<p>and you are not going</p>
<p>to remain a maid much longer. Ask your father,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>to have a</p>
<p>waggon and mules ready for us at daybreak,</p>
<p>to take the rugs,</p>
<p>robes,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>girdles,</p>
<p>and you can ride,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>which will be much pleasanter for you</p>
<p>than walking,</p>
<p>for the washing-cisterns are some way from the town.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she had said this Minerva went away to Olympus,</p>
<p>which they say is</p>
<p>the everlasting home of the gods. Here no wind beats roughly,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>neither rain nor snow can fall; but it abides in everlasting sunshine</p>
<p>and in a great peacefulness of light,</p>
<p>wherein the blessed gods are</p>
<p>illumined for ever and ever. This was the place to which the goddess</p>
<p>went when she had given instructions to the girl.</p>
<p>By and by morning came and woke Nausicaa,</p>
<p>who began wondering about her</p>
<p>dream; she therefore went to the other end of the house to tell her</p>
<p>father and mother all about it,</p>
<p>and found them in their own room. Her</p>
<p>mother was sitting by the fireside spinning her purple yarn with her</p>
<p>maids around her,</p>
<p>and she happened to catch her father just as he was</p>
<p>going out to attend a meeting of the town council,</p>
<p>which the Phaeacian</p>
<p>aldermen had convened. She stopped him and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúPapa dear,</p>
<p>could you manage to let me have a good big waggon? I want</p>
<p>to take all our dirty clothes to the river and wash them. You are the</p>
<p>chief man here,</p>
<p>so it is only right that you should have a clean shirt</p>
<p>when you attend meetings of the council. Moreover,</p>
<p>you have five sons</p>
<p>at home,</p>
<p>two of them married,</p>
<p>while the other three are good looking</p>
<p>bachelors; you know they always like to have clean linen when they go</p>
<p>to a dance,</p>
<p>and I have been thinking about all this.‚Äù</p>
<p>She did not say a word about her own wedding,</p>
<p>for she did not like to,</p>
<p>but her father knew and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou shall have the mules,</p>
<p>my love,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>whatever else you have a mind for. Be off with you,</p>
<p>and the men shall</p>
<p>get you a good strong waggon with a body to it that will hold all your</p>
<p>clothes.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he gave his orders to the servants,</p>
<p>who got the waggon out,</p>
<p>harnessed the mules,</p>
<p>and put them to,</p>
<p>while the girl brought the</p>
<p>clothes down from the linen room and placed them on the waggon. Her</p>
<p>mother prepared her a basket of provisions with all sorts of good</p>
<p>things,</p>
<p>and a goat skin full of wine; the girl now got into the waggon,</p>
<p>and her mother gave her also a golden cruse of oil,</p>
<p>that she and her</p>
<p>women might anoint themselves. Then she took the whip and reins and</p>
<p>lashed the mules on,</p>
<p>whereon they set off,</p>
<p>and their hoofs clattered on</p>
<p>the road. They pulled without flagging,</p>
<p>and carried not only Nausicaa</p>
<p>and her wash of clothes,</p>
<p>but the maids also who were with her.</p>
<p>When they reached the water side they went to the washing cisterns,</p>
<p>through which there ran at all times enough pure water to wash any</p>
<p>quantity of linen,</p>
<p>no matter how dirty. Here they unharnessed the mules</p>
<p>and turned them out to feed on the sweet juicy herbage that grew by the</p>
<p>water side. They took the clothes out of the waggon,</p>
<p>put them in the</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>and vied with one another in treading them in the pits to get</p>
<p>the dirt out. After they had washed them and got them quite clean,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>laid them out by the sea side,</p>
<p>where the waves had raised a high beach</p>
<p>of shingle,</p>
<p>and set about washing themselves and anointing themselves</p>
<p>with olive oil. Then they got their dinner by the side of the stream,</p>
<p>and waited for the sun to finish drying the clothes. When they had done</p>
<p>dinner they threw off the veils that covered their heads and began to</p>
<p>play at ball,</p>
<p>while Nausicaa sang for them. As the huntress Diana goes</p>
<p>forth upon the mountains of Taygetus or Erymanthus to hunt wild boars</p>
<p>or deer,</p>
<p>and the wood nymphs,</p>
<p>daughters of Aegis-bearing Jove,</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>their sport along with her (then is Leto proud at seeing her daughter</p>
<p>stand a full head taller than the others,</p>
<p>and eclipse the loveliest</p>
<p>amid a whole bevy of beauties),</p>
<p>even so did the girl outshine her</p>
<p>handmaids.</p>
<p>When it was time for them to start home,</p>
<p>and they were folding the</p>
<p>clothes and putting them into the waggon,</p>
<p>Minerva began to consider how</p>
<p>Ulysses should wake up and see the handsome girl who was to conduct him</p>
<p>to the city of the Phaeacians. The girl,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>threw a ball at one</p>
<p>of the maids,</p>
<p>which missed her and fell into deep water. On this they</p>
<p>all shouted,</p>
<p>and the noise they made woke Ulysses,</p>
<p>who sat up in his</p>
<p>bed of leaves and began to wonder what it might all be.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he to himself,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat kind of people have I come amongst?</p>
<p>Are they cruel,</p>
<p>savage,</p>
<p>and uncivilised,</p>
<p>or hospitable and humane? I</p>
<p>seem to hear the voices of young women,</p>
<p>and they sound like those of</p>
<p>the nymphs that haunt mountain tops,</p>
<p>or springs of rivers and meadows</p>
<p>of green grass. At any rate I am among a race of men and women. Let me</p>
<p>try if I cannot manage to get a look at them.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he said this he crept from under his bush,</p>
<p>and broke off a bough</p>
<p>covered with thick leaves to hide his nakedness. He looked like some</p>
<p>lion of the wilderness that stalks about exulting in his strength and</p>
<p>defying both wind and rain; his eyes glare as he prowls in quest of</p>
<p>oxen,</p>
<p>sheep,</p>
<p>or deer,</p>
<p>for he is famished,</p>
<p>and will dare break even into</p>
<p>a well fenced homestead,</p>
<p>trying to get at the sheep‚Äîeven such did</p>
<p>Ulysses seem to the young women,</p>
<p>as he drew near to them all naked as</p>
<p>he was,</p>
<p>for he was in great want. On seeing one so unkempt and so</p>
<p>begrimed with salt water,</p>
<p>the others scampered off along the spits that</p>
<p>jutted out into the sea,</p>
<p>but the daughter of Alcinous stood firm,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Minerva put courage into her heart and took away all fear from her. She</p>
<p>stood right in front of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and he doubted whether he should go up</p>
<p>to her,</p>
<p>throw himself at her feet,</p>
<p>and embrace her knees as a</p>
<p>suppliant,</p>
<p>or stay where he was and entreat her to give him some</p>
<p>clothes and show him the way to the town. In the end he deemed it best</p>
<p>to entreat her from a distance in case the girl should take offence at</p>
<p>his coming near enough to clasp her knees,</p>
<p>so he addressed her in</p>
<p>honeyed and persuasive language.</p>
<p>‚ÄúO queen,</p>
<p>‚Äù he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI implore your aid‚Äîbut tell me,</p>
<p>are you a goddess</p>
<p>or are you a mortal woman? If you are a goddess and dwell in heaven,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>can only conjecture that you are Jove‚Äôs daughter Diana,</p>
<p>for your face</p>
<p>and figure resemble none but hers; if on the other hand you are a</p>
<p>mortal and live on earth,</p>
<p>thrice happy are your father and</p>
<p>mother‚Äîthrice happy,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>are your brothers and sisters; how proud and</p>
<p>delighted they must feel when they see so fair a scion as yourself</p>
<p>going out to a dance; most happy,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>of all will he be whose</p>
<p>wedding gifts have been the richest,</p>
<p>and who takes you to his own home.</p>
<p>I never yet saw any one so beautiful,</p>
<p>neither man nor woman,</p>
<p>and am</p>
<p>lost in admiration as I behold you. I can only compare you to a young</p>
<p>palm tree which I saw when I was at Delos growing near the altar of</p>
<p>Apollo‚Äîfor I was there,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>with much people after me,</p>
<p>when I was on</p>
<p>that journey which has been the source of all my troubles. Never yet</p>
<p>did such a young plant shoot out of the ground as that was,</p>
<p>and I</p>
<p>admired and wondered at it exactly as I now admire and wonder at</p>
<p>yourself. I dare not clasp your knees,</p>
<p>but I am in great distress;</p>
<p>yesterday made the twentieth day that I had been tossing about upon the</p>
<p>sea. The winds and waves have taken me all the way from the Ogygian</p>
<p>island,</p>
<p>55 and now fate has flung me upon this coast that I may endure</p>
<p>still further suffering; for I do not think that I have yet come to the</p>
<p>end of it,</p>
<p>but rather that heaven has still much evil in store for me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd now,</p>
<p>O queen,</p>
<p>have pity upon me,</p>
<p>for you are the first person I</p>
<p>have met,</p>
<p>and I know no one else in this country. Show me the way to</p>
<p>your town,</p>
<p>and let me have anything that you may have brought hither to</p>
<p>wrap your clothes in. May heaven grant you in all things your heart‚Äôs</p>
<p>desire‚Äîhusband,</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and a happy,</p>
<p>peaceful home; for there is nothing</p>
<p>better in this world than that man and wife should be of one mind in a</p>
<p>house. It discomfits their enemies,</p>
<p>makes the hearts of their friends</p>
<p>glad,</p>
<p>and they themselves know more about it than any one.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Nausicaa answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>you appear to be a sensible,</p>
<p>well-disposed person. There is no accounting for luck; Jove gives</p>
<p>prosperity to rich and poor just as he chooses,</p>
<p>so you must take what</p>
<p>he has seen fit to send you,</p>
<p>and make the best of it. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that you have come to this our country,</p>
<p>you shall not want for clothes</p>
<p>nor for anything else that a foreigner in distress may reasonably look</p>
<p>for. I will show you the way to the town,</p>
<p>and will tell you the name of</p>
<p>our people; we are called Phaeacians,</p>
<p>and I am daughter to Alcinous,</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>whom the whole power of the state is vested.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then she called her maids and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStay where you are,</p>
<p>you girls. Can</p>
<p>you not see a man without running away from him? Do you take him for a</p>
<p>robber or a murderer? Neither he nor any one else can come here to do</p>
<p>us Phaeacians any harm,</p>
<p>for we are dear to the gods,</p>
<p>and live apart on</p>
<p>a land‚Äôs end that juts into the sounding sea,</p>
<p>and have nothing to do</p>
<p>with any other people. This is only some poor man who has lost his way,</p>
<p>and we must be kind to him,</p>
<p>for strangers and foreigners in distress</p>
<p>are under Jove‚Äôs protection,</p>
<p>and will take what they can get and be</p>
<p>thankful; so,</p>
<p>girls,</p>
<p>give the poor fellow something to eat and drink,</p>
<p>and wash him in the stream at some place that is sheltered from the</p>
<p>wind.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the maids left off running away and began calling one another</p>
<p>back. They made Ulysses sit down in the shelter as Nausicaa had told</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>and brought him a shirt and cloak. They also brought him the</p>
<p>little golden cruse of oil,</p>
<p>and told him to go and wash in the stream.</p>
<p>But Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYoung women,</p>
<p>please to stand a little on one side</p>
<p>that I may wash the brine from my shoulders and anoint myself with oil,</p>
<p>for it is long enough since my skin has had a drop of oil upon it. I</p>
<p>cannot wash as long as you all keep standing there. I am ashamed to</p>
<p>strip56 before a number of good looking young women.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then they stood on one side and went to tell the girl,</p>
<p>while Ulysses</p>
<p>washed himself in the stream and scrubbed the brine from his back and</p>
<p>from his broad shoulders. When he had thoroughly washed himself,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>had got the brine out of his hair,</p>
<p>he anointed himself with oil,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>put on the clothes which the girl had given him; Minerva then made him</p>
<p>look taller and stronger than before,</p>
<p>she also made the hair grow thick</p>
<p>on the top of his head,</p>
<p>and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;</p>
<p>she glorified him about the head and shoulders as a skilful workman who</p>
<p>has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan and Minerva enriches a piece</p>
<p>of silver plate by gilding it‚Äîand his work is full of beauty. Then he</p>
<p>went and sat down a little way off upon the beach,</p>
<p>looking quite young</p>
<p>and handsome,</p>
<p>and the girl gazed on him with admiration; then she said</p>
<p>to her maids:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHush,</p>
<p>my dears,</p>
<p>for I want to say something. I believe the gods who</p>
<p>live in heaven have sent this man to the Phaeacians. When I first saw</p>
<p>him I thought him plain,</p>
<p>but now his appearance is like that of the</p>
<p>gods who dwell in heaven. I should like my future husband to be just</p>
<p>such another as he is,</p>
<p>if he would only stay here and not want to go</p>
<p>away. However,</p>
<p>give him something to eat and drink.‚Äù</p>
<p>They did as they were told,</p>
<p>and set food before Ulysses,</p>
<p>who ate and</p>
<p>drank ravenously,</p>
<p>for it was long since he had had food of any kind.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,</p>
<p>Nausicaa bethought her of another matter. She got the linen</p>
<p>folded and placed in the waggon,</p>
<p>she then yoked the mules,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>as she</p>
<p>took her seat,</p>
<p>she called Ulysses:</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúrise and let us be going back to the town; I</p>
<p>will introduce you at the house of my excellent father,</p>
<p>where I can</p>
<p>tell you that you will meet all the best people among the Phaeacians.</p>
<p>But be sure and do as I bid you,</p>
<p>for you seem to be a sensible person.</p>
<p>As long as we are going past the fields and farm lands,</p>
<p>follow briskly</p>
<p>behind the waggon along with the maids and I will lead the way myself.</p>
<p>Presently,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>we shall come to the town,</p>
<p>where you will find a</p>
<p>high wall running all round it,</p>
<p>and a good harbour on either side with</p>
<p>a narrow entrance into the city,</p>
<p>and the ships will be drawn up by the</p>
<p>road side,</p>
<p>for every one has a place where his own ship can lie. You</p>
<p>will see the market place with a temple of Neptune in the middle of it,</p>
<p>and paved with large stones bedded in the earth. Here people deal in</p>
<p>ship‚Äôs gear of all kinds,</p>
<p>such as cables and sails,</p>
<p>and here,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>the places where oars are made,</p>
<p>for the Phaeacians are not a nation of</p>
<p>archers; they know nothing about bows and arrows,</p>
<p>but are a sea-faring</p>
<p>folk,</p>
<p>and pride themselves on their masts,</p>
<p>oars,</p>
<p>and ships,</p>
<p>with which</p>
<p>they travel far over the sea.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am afraid of the gossip and scandal that may be set on foot against</p>
<p>me later on; for the people here are very ill-natured,</p>
<p>and some low</p>
<p>fellow,</p>
<p>if he met us,</p>
<p>might say,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWho is this fine-looking stranger</p>
<p>that is going about with Nausicaa? Where did she find him? I suppose</p>
<p>she is going to marry him. Perhaps he is a vagabond sailor whom she has</p>
<p>taken from some foreign vessel,</p>
<p>for we have no neighbours; or some god</p>
<p>has at last come down from heaven in answer to her prayers,</p>
<p>and she is</p>
<p>going to live with him all the rest of her life. It would be a good</p>
<p>thing if she would take herself off and find a husband somewhere else,</p>
<p>for she will not look at one of the many excellent young Phaeacians who</p>
<p>are in love with her.‚Äô This is the kind of disparaging remark that</p>
<p>would be made about me,</p>
<p>and I could not complain,</p>
<p>for I should myself</p>
<p>be scandalised at seeing any other girl do the like,</p>
<p>and go about with</p>
<p>men in spite of everybody,</p>
<p>while her father and mother were still</p>
<p>alive,</p>
<p>and without having been married in the face of all the world.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>you want my father to give you an escort and to help</p>
<p>you home,</p>
<p>do as I bid you; you will see a beautiful grove of poplars by</p>
<p>the road side dedicated to Minerva; it has a well in it and a meadow</p>
<p>all round it. Here my father has a field of rich garden ground,</p>
<p>about</p>
<p>as far from the town as a man‚Äôs voice will carry. Sit down there and</p>
<p>wait for a while till the rest of us can get into the town and reach my</p>
<p>father‚Äôs house. Then,</p>
<p>when you think we must have done this,</p>
<p>come into</p>
<p>the town and ask the way to the house of my father Alcinous. You will</p>
<p>have no difficulty in finding it; any child will point it out to you,</p>
<p>for no one else in the whole town has anything like such a fine house</p>
<p>as he has. When you have got past the gates and through the outer</p>
<p>court,</p>
<p>go right across the inner court till you come to my mother. You</p>
<p>will find her sitting by the fire and spinning her purple wool by</p>
<p>firelight. It is a fine sight to see her as she leans back against one</p>
<p>of the bearing-posts with her maids all ranged behind her. Close to her</p>
<p>seat stands that of my father,</p>
<p>on which he sits and topes like an</p>
<p>immortal god. Never mind him,</p>
<p>but go up to my mother,</p>
<p>and lay your</p>
<p>hands upon her knees if you would get home quickly. If you can gain her</p>
<p>over,</p>
<p>you may hope to see your own country again,</p>
<p>no matter how distant</p>
<p>it may be.‚Äù</p>
<p>So saying she lashed the mules with her whip and they left the river.</p>
<p>The mules drew well,</p>
<p>and their hoofs went up and down upon the road.</p>
<p>She was careful not to go too fast for Ulysses and the maids who were</p>
<p>following on foot along with the waggon,</p>
<p>so she plied her whip with</p>
<p>judgement. As the sun was going down they came to the sacred grove of</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and there Ulysses sat down and prayed to the mighty daughter</p>
<p>of Jove.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúdaughter of Aegis-bearing Jove,</p>
<p>unweariable,</p>
<p>hear</p>
<p>me now,</p>
<p>for you gave no heed to my prayers when Neptune was wrecking</p>
<p>me. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>have pity upon me and grant that I may find friends</p>
<p>and be hospitably received by the Phaeacians.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he pray,</p>
<p>and Minerva heard his prayer,</p>
<p>but she would not show</p>
<p>herself to him openly,</p>
<p>for she was afraid of her uncle Neptune,</p>
<p>who was</p>
<p>still furious in his endeavors to prevent Ulysses from getting home.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK VII</span>
<p>RECEPTION OF ULYSSES AT THE PALACE OF KING ALCINOUS.</p>
<p>Thus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>did Ulysses wait and pray; but the girl drove on to the</p>
<p>town. When she reached her father‚Äôs house she drew up at the gateway,</p>
<p>and her brothers‚Äîcomely as the gods‚Äîgathered round her,</p>
<p>took the mules</p>
<p>out of the waggon,</p>
<p>and carried the clothes into the house,</p>
<p>while she</p>
<p>went to her own room,</p>
<p>where an old servant,</p>
<p>Eurymedusa of Apeira,</p>
<p>lit</p>
<p>the fire for her. This old woman had been brought by sea from Apeira,</p>
<p>and had been chosen as a prize for Alcinous because he was king over</p>
<p>the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>and the people obeyed him as though he were a god.57</p>
<p>She had been nurse to Nausicaa,</p>
<p>and had now lit the fire for her,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>brought her supper for her into her own room.</p>
<p>Presently Ulysses got up to go towards the town; and Minerva shed a</p>
<p>thick mist all round him to hide him in case any of the proud</p>
<p>Phaeacians who met him should be rude to him,</p>
<p>or ask him who he was.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>as he was just entering the town,</p>
<p>she came towards him in the</p>
<p>likeness of a little girl carrying a pitcher. She stood right in front</p>
<p>of him,</p>
<p>and Ulysses said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear,</p>
<p>will you be so kind as to show me the house of king Alcinous?</p>
<p>I am an unfortunate foreigner in distress,</p>
<p>and do not know one in your</p>
<p>town and country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Minerva said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYes,</p>
<p>father stranger,</p>
<p>I will show you the house you</p>
<p>want,</p>
<p>for Alcinous lives quite close to my own father. I will go before</p>
<p>you and show the way,</p>
<p>but say not a word as you go,</p>
<p>and do not look at</p>
<p>any man,</p>
<p>nor ask him questions; for the people here cannot abide</p>
<p>strangers,</p>
<p>and do not like men who come from some other place. They are</p>
<p>a sea-faring folk,</p>
<p>and sail the seas by the grace of Neptune in ships</p>
<p>that glide along like thought,</p>
<p>or as a bird in the air.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this she led the way,</p>
<p>and Ulysses followed in her steps; but not one</p>
<p>of the Phaeacians could see him as he passed through the city in the</p>
<p>midst of them; for the great goddess Minerva in her good will towards</p>
<p>him had hidden him in a thick cloud of darkness. He admired their</p>
<p>harbours,</p>
<p>ships,</p>
<p>places of assembly,</p>
<p>and the lofty walls of the city,</p>
<p>which,</p>
<p>with the palisade on top of them,</p>
<p>were very striking,</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>they reached the king‚Äôs house Minerva said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the house,</p>
<p>father stranger,</p>
<p>which you would have me show you.</p>
<p>You will find a number of great people sitting at table,</p>
<p>but do not be</p>
<p>afraid; go straight in,</p>
<p>for the bolder a man is the more likely he is</p>
<p>to carry his point,</p>
<p>even though he is a stranger. First find the queen.</p>
<p>Her name is Arete,</p>
<p>and she comes of the same family as her husband</p>
<p>Alcinous. They both descend originally from Neptune,</p>
<p>who was father to</p>
<p>Nausithous by Periboea,</p>
<p>a woman of great beauty. Periboea was the</p>
<p>youngest daughter of Eurymedon,</p>
<p>who at one time reigned over the</p>
<p>giants,</p>
<p>but he ruined his ill-fated people and lost his own life to</p>
<p>boot.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNeptune,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>lay with his daughter,</p>
<p>and she had a son by him,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>great Nausithous,</p>
<p>who reigned over the Phaeacians. Nausithous had two</p>
<p>sons Rhexenor and Alcinous;58 Apollo killed the first of them while he</p>
<p>was still a bridegroom and without male issue; but he left a daughter</p>
<p>Arete,</p>
<p>whom Alcinous married,</p>
<p>and honours as no other woman is honoured</p>
<p>of all those that keep house along with their husbands.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus she both was,</p>
<p>and still is,</p>
<p>respected beyond measure by her</p>
<p>children,</p>
<p>by Alcinous himself,</p>
<p>and by the whole people,</p>
<p>who look upon</p>
<p>her as a goddess,</p>
<p>and greet her whenever she goes about the city,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>she is a thoroughly good woman both in head and heart,</p>
<p>and when any</p>
<p>women are friends of hers,</p>
<p>she will help their husbands also to settle</p>
<p>their disputes. If you can gain her good will,</p>
<p>you may have every hope</p>
<p>of seeing your friends again,</p>
<p>and getting safely back to your home and</p>
<p>country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Minerva left Scheria and went away over the sea. She went to</p>
<p>Marathon59 and to the spacious streets of Athens,</p>
<p>where she entered the</p>
<p>abode of Erechtheus; but Ulysses went on to the house of Alcinous,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he pondered much as he paused a while before reaching the threshold of</p>
<p>bronze,</p>
<p>for the splendour of the palace was like that of the sun or</p>
<p>moon. The walls on either side were of bronze from end to end,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>cornice was of blue enamel. The doors were gold,</p>
<p>and hung on pillars of</p>
<p>silver that rose from a floor of bronze,</p>
<p>while the lintel was silver</p>
<p>and the hook of the door was of gold.</p>
<p>On either side there stood gold and silver mastiffs which Vulcan,</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>his consummate skill,</p>
<p>had fashioned expressly to keep watch over the</p>
<p>palace of king Alcinous; so they were immortal and could never grow</p>
<p>old. Seats were ranged all along the wall,</p>
<p>here and there from one end</p>
<p>to the other,</p>
<p>with coverings of fine woven work which the women of the</p>
<p>house had made. Here the chief persons of the Phaeacians used to sit</p>
<p>and eat and drink,</p>
<p>for there was abundance at all seasons; and there</p>
<p>were golden figures of young men with lighted torches in their hands,</p>
<p>raised on pedestals,</p>
<p>to give light by night to those who were at table.</p>
<p>There are60 fifty maid servants in the house,</p>
<p>some of whom are always</p>
<p>grinding rich yellow grain at the mill,</p>
<p>while others work at the loom,</p>
<p>or sit and spin,</p>
<p>and their shuttles go backwards and forwards like the</p>
<p>fluttering of aspen leaves,</p>
<p>while the linen is so closely woven that it</p>
<p>will turn oil. As the Phaeacians are the best sailors in the world,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>their women excel all others in weaving,</p>
<p>for Minerva has taught them</p>
<p>all manner of useful arts,</p>
<p>and they are very intelligent.</p>
<p>Outside the gate of the outer court there is a large garden of about</p>
<p>four acres with a wall all round it. It is full of beautiful</p>
<p>trees‚Äîpears,</p>
<p>pomegranates,</p>
<p>and the most delicious apples. There are</p>
<p>luscious figs also,</p>
<p>and olives in full growth. The fruits never rot nor</p>
<p>fail all the year round,</p>
<p>neither winter nor summer,</p>
<p>for the air is so</p>
<p>soft that a new crop ripens before the old has dropped. Pear grows on</p>
<p>pear,</p>
<p>apple on apple,</p>
<p>and fig on fig,</p>
<p>and so also with the grapes,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>there is an excellent vineyard: on the level ground of a part of this,</p>
<p>the grapes are being made into raisins; in another part they are being</p>
<p>gathered; some are being trodden in the wine tubs,</p>
<p>others further on</p>
<p>have shed their blossom and are beginning to show fruit,</p>
<p>others again</p>
<p>are just changing colour. In the furthest part of the ground there are</p>
<p>beautifully arranged beds of flowers that are in bloom all the year</p>
<p>round. Two streams go through it,</p>
<p>the one turned in ducts throughout</p>
<p>the whole garden,</p>
<p>while the other is carried under the ground of the</p>
<p>outer court to the house itself,</p>
<p>and the town‚Äôs people draw water from</p>
<p>it. Such,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>were the splendours with which the gods had endowed the</p>
<p>house of king Alcinous.</p>
<p>So here Ulysses stood for a while and looked about him,</p>
<p>but when he had</p>
<p>looked long enough he crossed the threshold and went within the</p>
<p>precincts of the house. There he found all the chief people among the</p>
<p>Phaeacians making their drink offerings to Mercury,</p>
<p>which they always</p>
<p>did the last thing before going away for the night.61 He went straight</p>
<p>through the court,</p>
<p>still hidden by the cloak of darkness in which</p>
<p>Minerva had enveloped him,</p>
<p>till he reached Arete and King Alcinous;</p>
<p>then he laid his hands upon the knees of the queen,</p>
<p>and at that moment</p>
<p>the miraculous darkness fell away from him and he became visible. Every</p>
<p>one was speechless with surprise at seeing a man there,</p>
<p>but Ulysses</p>
<p>began at once with his petition.</p>
<p>‚ÄúQueen Arete,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúdaughter of great Rhexenor,</p>
<p>in my</p>
<p>distress I humbly pray you,</p>
<p>as also your husband and these your guests</p>
<p>(whom may heaven prosper with long life and happiness,</p>
<p>and may they</p>
<p>leave their possessions to their children,</p>
<p>and all the honours</p>
<p>conferred upon them by the state) to help me home to my own country as</p>
<p>soon as possible; for I have been long in trouble and away from my</p>
<p>friends.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he sat down on the hearth among the ashes and they all held their</p>
<p>peace,</p>
<p>till presently the old hero Echeneus,</p>
<p>who was an excellent</p>
<p>speaker and an elder among the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>plainly and in all honesty</p>
<p>addressed them thus:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlcinous,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúit is not creditable to you that a stranger</p>
<p>should be seen sitting among the ashes of your hearth; every one is</p>
<p>waiting to hear what you are about to say; tell him,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>to rise and</p>
<p>take a seat on a stool inlaid with silver,</p>
<p>and bid your servants mix</p>
<p>some wine and water that we may make a drink offering to Jove the lord</p>
<p>of thunder,</p>
<p>who takes all well disposed suppliants under his</p>
<p>protection; and let the housekeeper give him some supper,</p>
<p>of whatever</p>
<p>there may be in the house.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Alcinous heard this he took Ulysses by the hand,</p>
<p>raised him from</p>
<p>the hearth,</p>
<p>and bade him take the seat of Laodamas,</p>
<p>who had been</p>
<p>sitting beside him,</p>
<p>and was his favourite son. A maid servant then</p>
<p>brought him water in a beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a</p>
<p>silver basin for him to wash his hands,</p>
<p>and she drew a clean table</p>
<p>beside him; an upper servant brought him bread and offered him many</p>
<p>good things of what there was in the house,</p>
<p>and Ulysses ate and drank.</p>
<p>Then Alcinous said to one of the servants,</p>
<p>‚ÄúPontonous,</p>
<p>mix a cup of</p>
<p>wine and hand it round that we may make drink-offerings to Jove the</p>
<p>lord of thunder,</p>
<p>who is the protector of all well-disposed suppliants.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pontonous then mixed wine and water,</p>
<p>and handed it round after giving</p>
<p>every man his drink-offering. When they had made their offerings,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>had drunk each as much as he was minded,</p>
<p>Alcinous said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>hear my words. You</p>
<p>have had your supper,</p>
<p>so now go home to bed. To-morrow morning I shall</p>
<p>invite a still larger number of aldermen,</p>
<p>and will give a sacrificial</p>
<p>banquet in honour of our guest; we can then discuss the question of his</p>
<p>escort,</p>
<p>and consider how we may at once send him back rejoicing to his</p>
<p>own country without trouble or inconvenience to himself,</p>
<p>no matter how</p>
<p>distant it may be. We must see that he comes to no harm while on his</p>
<p>homeward journey,</p>
<p>but when he is once at home he will have to take the</p>
<p>luck he was born with for better or worse like other people. It is</p>
<p>possible,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that the stranger is one of the immortals who has</p>
<p>come down from heaven to visit us; but in this case the gods are</p>
<p>departing from their usual practice,</p>
<p>for hitherto they have made</p>
<p>themselves perfectly clear to us when we have been offering them</p>
<p>hecatombs. They come and sit at our feasts just like one of our selves,</p>
<p>and if any solitary wayfarer happens to stumble upon some one or other</p>
<p>of them,</p>
<p>they affect no concealment,</p>
<p>for we are as near of kin to the</p>
<p>gods as the Cyclopes and the savage giants are.‚Äù62</p>
<p>Then Ulysses said: ‚ÄúPray,</p>
<p>Alcinous,</p>
<p>do not take any such notion into</p>
<p>your head. I have nothing of the immortal about me,</p>
<p>neither in body nor</p>
<p>mind,</p>
<p>and most resemble those among you who are the most afflicted.</p>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<p>were I to tell you all that heaven has seen fit to lay upon me,</p>
<p>you would say that I was still worse off than they are. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>let me sup in spite of sorrow,</p>
<p>for an empty stomach is a very</p>
<p>importunate thing,</p>
<p>and thrusts itself on a man‚Äôs notice no matter how</p>
<p>dire is his distress. I am in great trouble,</p>
<p>yet it insists that I</p>
<p>shall eat and drink,</p>
<p>bids me lay aside all memory of my sorrows and</p>
<p>dwell only on the due replenishing of itself. As for yourselves,</p>
<p>do as</p>
<p>you propose,</p>
<p>and at break of day set about helping me to get home. I</p>
<p>shall be content to die if I may first once more behold my property,</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>bondsmen,</p>
<p>and all the greatness of my house.‚Äù63</p>
<p>Thus did he speak. Every one approved his saying,</p>
<p>and agreed that he</p>
<p>should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken reasonably. Then when</p>
<p>they had made their drink offerings,</p>
<p>and had drunk each as much as he</p>
<p>was minded they went home to bed every man in his own abode,</p>
<p>leaving</p>
<p>Ulysses in the cloister with Arete and Alcinous while the servants were</p>
<p>taking the things away after supper. Arete was the first to speak,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>she recognised the shirt,</p>
<p>cloak,</p>
<p>and good clothes that Ulysses was</p>
<p>wearing,</p>
<p>as the work of herself and of her maids; so she said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>before we go any further,</p>
<p>there is a question I should like</p>
<p>to ask you. Who,</p>
<p>and whence are you,</p>
<p>and who gave you those clothes?</p>
<p>Did you not say you had come here from beyond the sea?‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt would be a long story Madam,</p>
<p>were I to relate</p>
<p>in full the tale of my misfortunes,</p>
<p>for the hand of heaven has been</p>
<p>laid heavy upon me; but as regards your question,</p>
<p>there is an island</p>
<p>far away in the sea which is called ‚Äòthe Ogygian.‚Äô Here dwells the</p>
<p>cunning and powerful goddess Calypso,</p>
<p>daughter of Atlas. She lives by</p>
<p>herself far from all neighbours human or divine. Fortune,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>brought me to her hearth all desolate and alone,</p>
<p>for Jove struck my</p>
<p>ship with his thunderbolts,</p>
<p>and broke it up in mid-ocean. My brave</p>
<p>comrades were drowned every man of them,</p>
<p>but I stuck to the keel and</p>
<p>was carried hither and thither for the space of nine days,</p>
<p>till at last</p>
<p>during the darkness of the tenth night the gods brought me to the</p>
<p>Ogygian island where the great goddess Calypso lives. She took me in</p>
<p>and treated me with the utmost kindness; indeed she wanted to make me</p>
<p>immortal that I might never grow old,</p>
<p>but she could not persuade me to</p>
<p>let her do so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stayed with Calypso seven years straight on end,</p>
<p>and watered the</p>
<p>good clothes she gave me with my tears during the whole time; but at</p>
<p>last when the eighth year came round she bade me depart of her own free</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>either because Jove had told her she must,</p>
<p>or because she had</p>
<p>changed her mind. She sent me from her island on a raft,</p>
<p>which she</p>
<p>provisioned with abundance of bread and wine. Moreover she gave me good</p>
<p>stout clothing,</p>
<p>and sent me a wind that blew both warm and fair. Days</p>
<p>seven and ten did I sail over the sea,</p>
<p>and on the eighteenth I caught</p>
<p>sight of the first outlines of the mountains upon your coast‚Äîand glad</p>
<p>indeed was I to set eyes upon them. Nevertheless there was still much</p>
<p>trouble in store for me,</p>
<p>for at this point Neptune would let me go no</p>
<p>further,</p>
<p>and raised a great storm against me; the sea was so terribly</p>
<p>high that I could no longer keep to my raft,</p>
<p>which went to pieces under</p>
<p>the fury of the gale,</p>
<p>and I had to swim for it,</p>
<p>till wind and current</p>
<p>brought me to your shores.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere I tried to land,</p>
<p>but could not,</p>
<p>for it was a bad place and the</p>
<p>waves dashed me against the rocks,</p>
<p>so I again took to the sea and swam</p>
<p>on till I came to a river that seemed the most likely landing place,</p>
<p>for there were no rocks and it was sheltered from the wind. Here,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>I got out of the water and gathered my senses together again. Night was</p>
<p>coming on,</p>
<p>so I left the river,</p>
<p>and went into a thicket,</p>
<p>where I</p>
<p>covered myself all over with leaves,</p>
<p>and presently heaven sent me off</p>
<p>into a very deep sleep. Sick and sorry as I was I slept among the</p>
<p>leaves all night,</p>
<p>and through the next day till afternoon,</p>
<p>when I woke</p>
<p>as the sun was westering,</p>
<p>and saw your daughter‚Äôs maid servants playing</p>
<p>upon the beach,</p>
<p>and your daughter among them looking like a goddess. I</p>
<p>besought her aid,</p>
<p>and she proved to be of an excellent disposition,</p>
<p>much more so than could be expected from so young a person‚Äîfor young</p>
<p>people are apt to be thoughtless. She gave me plenty of bread and wine,</p>
<p>and when she had had me washed in the river she also gave me the</p>
<p>clothes in which you see me. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>though it has pained me to</p>
<p>do so,</p>
<p>I have told you the whole truth.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Alcinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>it was very wrong of my daughter not to</p>
<p>bring you on at once to my house along with the maids,</p>
<p>seeing that she</p>
<p>was the first person whose aid you asked.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúPray do not scold her,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses; ‚Äúshe is not to blame. She did</p>
<p>tell me to follow along with the maids,</p>
<p>but I was ashamed and afraid,</p>
<p>for I thought you might perhaps be displeased if you saw me. Every</p>
<p>human being is sometimes a little suspicious and irritable.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Alcinous,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not the kind of man to get angry</p>
<p>about nothing; it is always better to be reasonable; but by Father</p>
<p>Jove,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and Apollo,</p>
<p>now that I see what kind of person you are,</p>
<p>and how much you think as I do,</p>
<p>I wish you would stay here,</p>
<p>marry my</p>
<p>daughter,</p>
<p>and become my son-in-law. If you will stay I will give you a</p>
<p>house and an estate,</p>
<p>but no one (heaven forbid) shall keep you here</p>
<p>against your own wish,</p>
<p>and that you may be sure of this I will attend</p>
<p>tomorrow to the matter of your escort. You can sleep64 during the whole</p>
<p>voyage if you like,</p>
<p>and the men shall sail you over smooth waters</p>
<p>either to your own home,</p>
<p>or wherever you please,</p>
<p>even though it be a</p>
<p>long way further off than Euboea,</p>
<p>which those of my people who saw it</p>
<p>when they took yellow-haired Rhadamanthus to see Tityus the son of</p>
<p>Gaia,</p>
<p>tell me is the furthest of any place‚Äîand yet they did the whole</p>
<p>voyage in a single day without distressing themselves,</p>
<p>and came back</p>
<p>again afterwards. You will thus see how much my ships excel all others,</p>
<p>and what magnificent oarsmen my sailors are.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then was Ulysses glad and prayed aloud saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>grant that</p>
<p>Alcinous may do all as he has said,</p>
<p>for so he will win an imperishable</p>
<p>name among mankind,</p>
<p>and at the same time I shall return to my country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Then Arete told her maids to set a bed in the</p>
<p>room that was in the gatehouse,</p>
<p>and make it with good red rugs,</p>
<p>and to</p>
<p>spread coverlets on the top of them with woollen cloaks for Ulysses to</p>
<p>wear. The maids thereon went out with torches in their hands,</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>they had made the bed they came up to Ulysses and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúRise,</p>
<p>sir</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>and come with us for your bed is ready,</p>
<p>‚Äù and glad indeed was</p>
<p>he to go to his rest.</p>
<p>So Ulysses slept in a bed placed in a room over the echoing gateway;</p>
<p>but Alcinous lay in the inner part of the house,</p>
<p>with the queen his</p>
<p>wife by his side.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK VIII</span>
<p>BANQUET IN THE HOUSE OF ALCINOUS‚ÄîTHE GAMES.</p>
<p>Now when the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>Alcinous</p>
<p>and Ulysses both rose,</p>
<p>and Alcinous led the way to the Phaeacian place</p>
<p>of assembly,</p>
<p>which was near the ships. When they got there they sat</p>
<p>down side by side on a seat of polished stone,</p>
<p>while Minerva took the</p>
<p>form of one of Alcinous‚Äô servants,</p>
<p>and went round the town in order to</p>
<p>help Ulysses to get home. She went up to the citizens,</p>
<p>man by man,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>come to the</p>
<p>assembly all of you and listen to the stranger who has just come off a</p>
<p>long voyage to the house of King Alcinous; he looks like an immortal</p>
<p>god.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words she made them all want to come,</p>
<p>and they flocked to</p>
<p>the assembly till seats and standing room were alike crowded. Every one</p>
<p>was struck with the appearance of Ulysses,</p>
<p>for Minerva had beautified</p>
<p>him about the head and shoulders,</p>
<p>making him look taller and stouter</p>
<p>than he really was,</p>
<p>that he might impress the Phaeacians favourably as</p>
<p>being a very remarkable man,</p>
<p>and might come off well in the many trials</p>
<p>of skill to which they would challenge him. Then,</p>
<p>when they were got</p>
<p>together,</p>
<p>Alcinous spoke:</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúaldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>that I may speak even as I am minded. This stranger,</p>
<p>whoever he may be,</p>
<p>has found his way to my house from somewhere or other either East or</p>
<p>West. He wants an escort and wishes to have the matter settled. Let us</p>
<p>then get one ready for him,</p>
<p>as we have done for others before him;</p>
<p>indeed,</p>
<p>no one who ever yet came to my house has been able to complain</p>
<p>of me for not speeding on his way soon enough. Let us draw a ship into</p>
<p>the sea‚Äîone that has never yet made a voyage‚Äîand man her with two and</p>
<p>fifty of our smartest young sailors. Then when you have made fast your</p>
<p>oars each by his own seat,</p>
<p>leave the ship and come to my house to</p>
<p>prepare a feast.65 I will find you in everything. I am giving these</p>
<p>instructions to the young men who will form the crew,</p>
<p>for as regards</p>
<p>you aldermen and town councillors,</p>
<p>you will join me in entertaining our</p>
<p>guest in the cloisters. I can take no excuses,</p>
<p>and we will have</p>
<p>Demodocus to sing to us; for there is no bard like him whatever he may</p>
<p>choose to sing about.‚Äù</p>
<p>Alcinous then led the way,</p>
<p>and the others followed after,</p>
<p>while a</p>
<p>servant went to fetch Demodocus. The fifty-two picked oarsmen went to</p>
<p>the sea shore as they had been told,</p>
<p>and when they got there they drew</p>
<p>the ship into the water,</p>
<p>got her mast and sails inside her,</p>
<p>bound the</p>
<p>oars to the thole-pins with twisted thongs of leather,</p>
<p>all in due</p>
<p>course,</p>
<p>and spread the white sails aloft. They moored the vessel a</p>
<p>little way out from land,</p>
<p>and then came on shore and went to the house</p>
<p>of King Alcinous. The out houses,</p>
<p>66 yards,</p>
<p>and all the precincts were</p>
<p>filled with crowds of men in great multitudes both old and young; and</p>
<p>Alcinous killed them a dozen sheep,</p>
<p>eight full grown pigs,</p>
<p>and two</p>
<p>oxen. These they skinned and dressed so as to provide a magnificent</p>
<p>banquet.</p>
<p>A servant presently led in the famous bard Demodocus,</p>
<p>whom the muse had</p>
<p>dearly loved,</p>
<p>but to whom she had given both good and evil,</p>
<p>for though</p>
<p>she had endowed him with a divine gift of song,</p>
<p>she had robbed him of</p>
<p>his eyesight. Pontonous set a seat for him among the guests,</p>
<p>leaning it</p>
<p>up against a bearing-post. He hung the lyre for him on a peg over his</p>
<p>head,</p>
<p>and showed him where he was to feel for it with his hands. He</p>
<p>also set a fair table with a basket of victuals by his side,</p>
<p>and a cup</p>
<p>of wine from which he might drink whenever he was so disposed.</p>
<p>The company then laid their hands upon the good things that were before</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,</p>
<p>the muse</p>
<p>inspired Demodocus to sing the feats of heroes,</p>
<p>and more especially a</p>
<p>matter that was then in the mouths of all men,</p>
<p>to wit,</p>
<p>the quarrel</p>
<p>between Ulysses and Achilles,</p>
<p>and the fierce words that they heaped on</p>
<p>one another as they sat together at a banquet. But Agamemnon was glad</p>
<p>when he heard his chieftains quarrelling with one another,</p>
<p>for Apollo</p>
<p>had foretold him this at Pytho when he crossed the stone floor to</p>
<p>consult the oracle. Here was the beginning of the evil that by the will</p>
<p>of Jove fell both upon Danaans and Trojans.</p>
<p>Thus sang the bard,</p>
<p>but Ulysses drew his purple mantle over his head</p>
<p>and covered his face,</p>
<p>for he was ashamed to let the Phaeacians see that</p>
<p>he was weeping. When the bard left off singing he wiped the tears from</p>
<p>his eyes,</p>
<p>uncovered his face,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>taking his cup,</p>
<p>made a</p>
<p>drink-offering to the gods; but when the Phaeacians pressed Demodocus</p>
<p>to sing further,</p>
<p>for they delighted in his lays,</p>
<p>then Ulysses again</p>
<p>drew his mantle over his head and wept bitterly. No one noticed his</p>
<p>distress except Alcinous,</p>
<p>who was sitting near him,</p>
<p>and heard the heavy</p>
<p>sighs that he was heaving. So he at once said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAldermen and town</p>
<p>councillors of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>we have had enough now,</p>
<p>both of the</p>
<p>feast,</p>
<p>and of the minstrelsy that is its due accompaniment; let us</p>
<p>proceed therefore to the athletic sports,</p>
<p>so that our guest on his</p>
<p>return home may be able to tell his friends how much we surpass all</p>
<p>other nations as boxers,</p>
<p>wrestlers,</p>
<p>jumpers,</p>
<p>and runners.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he led the way,</p>
<p>and the others followed after. A</p>
<p>servant hung Demodocus‚Äôs lyre on its peg for him,</p>
<p>led him out of the</p>
<p>cloister,</p>
<p>and set him on the same way as that along which all the chief</p>
<p>men of the Phaeacians were going to see the sports; a crowd of several</p>
<p>thousands of people followed them,</p>
<p>and there were many excellent</p>
<p>competitors for all the prizes. Acroneos,</p>
<p>Ocyalus,</p>
<p>Elatreus,</p>
<p>Nauteus,</p>
<p>Prymneus,</p>
<p>Anchialus,</p>
<p>Eretmeus,</p>
<p>Ponteus,</p>
<p>Proreus,</p>
<p>Thoon,</p>
<p>Anabesineus,</p>
<p>and Amphialus son of Polyneus son of Tecton. There was also Euryalus</p>
<p>son of Naubolus,</p>
<p>who was like Mars himself,</p>
<p>and was the best looking</p>
<p>man among the Phaeacians except Laodamas. Three sons of Alcinous,</p>
<p>Laodamas,</p>
<p>Halios,</p>
<p>and Clytoneus,</p>
<p>competed also.</p>
<p>The foot races came first. The course was set out for them from the</p>
<p>starting post,</p>
<p>and they raised a dust upon the plain as they all flew</p>
<p>forward at the same moment. Clytoneus came in first by a long way; he</p>
<p>left every one else behind him by the length of the furrow that a</p>
<p>couple of mules can plough in a fallow field.67 They then turned to the</p>
<p>painful art of wrestling,</p>
<p>and here Euryalus proved to be the best man.</p>
<p>Amphialus excelled all the others in jumping,</p>
<p>while at throwing the</p>
<p>disc there was no one who could approach Elatreus. Alcinous‚Äôs son</p>
<p>Laodamas was the best boxer,</p>
<p>and he it was who presently said,</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>they had all been diverted with the games,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet us ask the stranger</p>
<p>whether he excels in any of these sports; he seems very powerfully</p>
<p>built; his thighs,</p>
<p>calves,</p>
<p>hands,</p>
<p>and neck are of prodigious strength,</p>
<p>nor is he at all old,</p>
<p>but he has suffered much lately,</p>
<p>and there is</p>
<p>nothing like the sea for making havoc with a man,</p>
<p>no matter how strong</p>
<p>he is.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are quite right,</p>
<p>Laodamas,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Euryalus,</p>
<p>‚Äúgo up to your guest</p>
<p>and speak to him about it yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Laodamas heard this he made his way into the middle of the crowd</p>
<p>and said to Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>that you will enter yourself for</p>
<p>some one or other of our competitions if you are skilled in any of</p>
<p>them‚Äîand you must have gone in for many a one before now. There is</p>
<p>nothing that does any one so much credit all his life long as the</p>
<p>showing himself a proper man with his hands and feet. Have a try</p>
<p>therefore at something,</p>
<p>and banish all sorrow from your mind. Your</p>
<p>return home will not be long delayed,</p>
<p>for the ship is already drawn</p>
<p>into the water,</p>
<p>and the crew is found.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLaodamas,</p>
<p>why do you taunt me in this way? my mind</p>
<p>is set rather on cares than contests; I have been through infinite</p>
<p>trouble,</p>
<p>and am come among you now as a suppliant,</p>
<p>praying your king</p>
<p>and people to further me on my return home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Euryalus reviled him outright and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI gather,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>that you</p>
<p>are unskilled in any of the many sports that men generally delight in.</p>
<p>I suppose you are one of those grasping traders that go about in ships</p>
<p>as captains or merchants,</p>
<p>and who think of nothing but of their outward</p>
<p>freights and homeward cargoes. There does not seem to be much of the</p>
<p>athlete about you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor shame,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>fiercely,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou are an insolent</p>
<p>fellow‚Äîso true is it that the gods do not grace all men alike in</p>
<p>speech,</p>
<p>person,</p>
<p>and understanding. One man may be of weak presence,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>heaven has adorned this with such a good conversation that he charms</p>
<p>every one who sees him; his honeyed moderation carries his hearers with</p>
<p>him so that he is leader in all assemblies of his fellows,</p>
<p>and wherever</p>
<p>he goes he is looked up to. Another may be as handsome as a god,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>his good looks are not crowned with discretion. This is your case. No</p>
<p>god could make a finer looking fellow than you are,</p>
<p>but you are a fool.</p>
<p>Your ill-judged remarks have made me exceedingly angry,</p>
<p>and you are</p>
<p>quite mistaken,</p>
<p>for I excel in a great many athletic exercises; indeed,</p>
<p>so long as I had youth and strength,</p>
<p>I was among the first athletes of</p>
<p>the age. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I am worn out by labour and sorrow,</p>
<p>for I have</p>
<p>gone through much both on the field of battle and by the waves of the</p>
<p>weary sea; still,</p>
<p>in spite of all this I will compete,</p>
<p>for your taunts</p>
<p>have stung me to the quick.‚Äù</p>
<p>So he hurried up without even taking his cloak off,</p>
<p>and seized a disc,</p>
<p>larger,</p>
<p>more massive and much heavier than those used by the Phaeacians</p>
<p>when disc-throwing among themselves.68 Then,</p>
<p>swinging it back,</p>
<p>he threw</p>
<p>it from his brawny hand,</p>
<p>and it made a humming sound in the air as he</p>
<p>did so. The Phaeacians quailed beneath the rushing of its flight as it</p>
<p>sped gracefully from his hand,</p>
<p>and flew beyond any mark that had been</p>
<p>made yet. Minerva,</p>
<p>in the form of a man,</p>
<p>came and marked the place</p>
<p>where it had fallen. ‚ÄúA blind man,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúcould easily tell</p>
<p>your mark by groping for it‚Äîit is so far ahead of any other. You may</p>
<p>make your mind easy about this contest,</p>
<p>for no Phaeacian can come near</p>
<p>to such a throw as yours.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses was glad when he found he had a friend among the lookers-on,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>he began to speak more pleasantly. ‚ÄúYoung men,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúcome up to</p>
<p>that throw if you can,</p>
<p>and I will throw another disc as heavy or even</p>
<p>heavier. If anyone wants to have a bout with me let him come on,</p>
<p>for I</p>
<p>am exceedingly angry; I will box,</p>
<p>wrestle,</p>
<p>or run,</p>
<p>I do not care what</p>
<p>it is,</p>
<p>with any man of you all except Laodamas,</p>
<p>but not with him</p>
<p>because I am his guest,</p>
<p>and one cannot compete with one‚Äôs own personal</p>
<p>friend. At least I do not think it a prudent or a sensible thing for a</p>
<p>guest to challenge his host‚Äôs family at any game,</p>
<p>especially when he is</p>
<p>in a foreign country. He will cut the ground from under his own feet if</p>
<p>he does; but I make no exception as regards any one else,</p>
<p>for I want to</p>
<p>have the matter out and know which is the best man. I am a good hand at</p>
<p>every kind of athletic sport known among mankind. I am an excellent</p>
<p>archer. In battle I am always the first to bring a man down with my</p>
<p>arrow,</p>
<p>no matter how many more are taking aim at him alongside of me.</p>
<p>Philoctetes was the only man who could shoot better than I could when</p>
<p>we Achaeans were before Troy and in practice. I far excel every one</p>
<p>else in the whole world,</p>
<p>of those who still eat bread upon the face of</p>
<p>the earth,</p>
<p>but I should not like to shoot against the mighty dead,</p>
<p>such</p>
<p>as Hercules,</p>
<p>or Eurytus the Oechalian‚Äîmen who could shoot against the</p>
<p>gods themselves. This in fact was how Eurytus came prematurely by his</p>
<p>end,</p>
<p>for Apollo was angry with him and killed him because he challenged</p>
<p>him as an archer. I can throw a dart farther than any one else can</p>
<p>shoot an arrow. Running is the only point in respect of which I am</p>
<p>afraid some of the Phaeacians might beat me,</p>
<p>for I have been brought</p>
<p>down very low at sea; my provisions ran short,</p>
<p>and therefore I am still</p>
<p>weak.‚Äù</p>
<p>They all held their peace except King Alcinous,</p>
<p>who began,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>have had much pleasure in hearing all that you have told us,</p>
<p>from which</p>
<p>I understand that you are willing to show your prowess,</p>
<p>as having been</p>
<p>displeased with some insolent remarks that have been made to you by one</p>
<p>of our athletes,</p>
<p>and which could never have been uttered by any one who</p>
<p>knows how to talk with propriety. I hope you will apprehend my meaning,</p>
<p>and will explain to any one of your chief men who may be dining with</p>
<p>yourself and your family when you get home,</p>
<p>that we have an hereditary</p>
<p>aptitude for accomplishments of all kinds. We are not particularly</p>
<p>remarkable for our boxing,</p>
<p>nor yet as wrestlers,</p>
<p>but we are singularly</p>
<p>fleet of foot and are excellent sailors. We are extremely fond of good</p>
<p>dinners,</p>
<p>music,</p>
<p>and dancing; we also like frequent changes of linen,</p>
<p>warm baths,</p>
<p>and good beds,</p>
<p>so now,</p>
<p>please,</p>
<p>some of you who are the best</p>
<p>dancers set about dancing,</p>
<p>that our guest on his return home may be</p>
<p>able to tell his friends how much we surpass all other nations as</p>
<p>sailors,</p>
<p>runners,</p>
<p>dancers,</p>
<p>and minstrels. Demodocus has left his lyre</p>
<p>at my house,</p>
<p>so run some one or other of you and fetch it for him.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this a servant hurried off to bring the lyre from the king‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>and the nine men who had been chosen as stewards stood forward. It was</p>
<p>their business to manage everything connected with the sports,</p>
<p>so they</p>
<p>made the ground smooth and marked a wide space for the dancers.</p>
<p>Presently the servant came back with Demodocus‚Äôs lyre,</p>
<p>and he took his</p>
<p>place in the midst of them,</p>
<p>whereon the best young dancers in the town</p>
<p>began to foot and trip it so nimbly that Ulysses was delighted with the</p>
<p>merry twinkling of their feet.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the bard began to sing the loves of Mars and Venus,</p>
<p>and how</p>
<p>they first began their intrigue in the house of Vulcan. Mars made Venus</p>
<p>many presents,</p>
<p>and defiled King Vulcan‚Äôs marriage bed,</p>
<p>so the sun,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>saw what they were about,</p>
<p>told Vulcan. Vulcan was very angry when he</p>
<p>heard such dreadful news,</p>
<p>so he went to his smithy brooding mischief,</p>
<p>got his great anvil into its place,</p>
<p>and began to forge some chains</p>
<p>which none could either unloose or break,</p>
<p>so that they might stay there</p>
<p>in that place.69 When he had finished his snare he went into his</p>
<p>bedroom and festooned the bed-posts all over with chains like cobwebs;</p>
<p>he also let many hang down from the great beam of the ceiling. Not even</p>
<p>a god could see them so fine and subtle were they. As soon as he had</p>
<p>spread the chains all over the bed,</p>
<p>he made as though he were setting</p>
<p>out for the fair state of Lemnos,</p>
<p>which of all places in the world was</p>
<p>the one he was most fond of. But Mars kept no blind look out,</p>
<p>and as</p>
<p>soon as he saw him start,</p>
<p>hurried off to his house,</p>
<p>burning with love</p>
<p>for Venus.</p>
<p>Now Venus was just come in from a visit to her father Jove,</p>
<p>and was</p>
<p>about sitting down when Mars came inside the house,</p>
<p>and said as he took</p>
<p>her hand in his own,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet us go to the couch of Vulcan: he is not at</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>but is gone off to Lemnos among the Sintians,</p>
<p>whose speech is</p>
<p>barbarous.‚Äù</p>
<p>She was nothing loth,</p>
<p>so they went to the couch to take their rest,</p>
<p>whereon they were caught in the toils which cunning Vulcan had spread</p>
<p>for them,</p>
<p>and could neither get up nor stir hand or foot,</p>
<p>but found too</p>
<p>late that they were in a trap. Then Vulcan came up to them,</p>
<p>for he had</p>
<p>turned back before reaching Lemnos,</p>
<p>when his scout the sun told him</p>
<p>what was going on. He was in a furious passion,</p>
<p>and stood in the</p>
<p>vestibule making a dreadful noise as he shouted to all the gods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúand all you other blessed gods who live for</p>
<p>ever,</p>
<p>come here and see the ridiculous and disgraceful sight that I</p>
<p>will show you. Jove‚Äôs daughter Venus is always dishonouring me because</p>
<p>I am lame. She is in love with Mars,</p>
<p>who is handsome and clean built,</p>
<p>whereas I am a cripple‚Äîbut my parents are to blame for that,</p>
<p>not I;</p>
<p>they ought never to have begotten me. Come and see the pair together</p>
<p>asleep on my bed. It makes me furious to look at them. They are very</p>
<p>fond of one another,</p>
<p>but I do not think they will lie there longer than</p>
<p>they can help,</p>
<p>nor do I think that they will sleep much; there,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>they shall stay till her father has repaid me the sum I gave</p>
<p>him for his baggage of a daughter,</p>
<p>who is fair but not honest.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the gods gathered to the house of Vulcan. Earth-encircling</p>
<p>Neptune came,</p>
<p>and Mercury the bringer of luck,</p>
<p>and King Apollo,</p>
<p>but the</p>
<p>goddesses staid at home all of them for shame. Then the givers of all</p>
<p>good things stood in the doorway,</p>
<p>and the blessed gods roared with</p>
<p>inextinguishable laughter,</p>
<p>as they saw how cunning Vulcan had been,</p>
<p>whereon one would turn towards his neighbour saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIll deeds do not prosper,</p>
<p>and the weak confound the strong. See how</p>
<p>limping Vulcan,</p>
<p>lame as he is,</p>
<p>has caught Mars who is the fleetest god</p>
<p>in heaven; and now Mars will be cast in heavy damages.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse,</p>
<p>but King Apollo said to Mercury,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMessenger</p>
<p>Mercury,</p>
<p>giver of good things,</p>
<p>you would not care how strong the chains</p>
<p>were,</p>
<p>would you,</p>
<p>if you could sleep with Venus?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúKing Apollo,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Mercury,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI only wish I might get the chance,</p>
<p>though there were three times as many chains‚Äîand you might look on,</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>of you,</p>
<p>gods and goddesses,</p>
<p>but I would sleep with her if I could.‚Äù</p>
<p>The immortal gods burst out laughing as they heard him,</p>
<p>but Neptune</p>
<p>took it all seriously,</p>
<p>and kept on imploring Vulcan to set Mars free</p>
<p>again. ‚ÄúLet him go,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúand I will undertake,</p>
<p>as you require,</p>
<p>that he shall pay you all the damages that are held reasonable among</p>
<p>the immortal gods.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Vulcan,</p>
<p>‚Äúask me to do this; a bad man‚Äôs bond is bad</p>
<p>security; what remedy could I enforce against you if Mars should go</p>
<p>away and leave his debts behind him along with his chains?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVulcan,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Neptune,</p>
<p>‚Äúif Mars goes away without paying his damages,</p>
<p>I will pay you myself.‚Äù So Vulcan answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn this case I cannot and</p>
<p>must not refuse you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thereon he loosed the bonds that bound them,</p>
<p>and as soon as they were</p>
<p>free they scampered off,</p>
<p>Mars to Thrace and laughter-loving Venus to</p>
<p>Cyprus and to Paphos,</p>
<p>where is her grove and her altar fragrant with</p>
<p>burnt offerings. Here the Graces bathed her,</p>
<p>and anointed her with oil</p>
<p>of ambrosia such as the immortal gods make use of,</p>
<p>and they clothed her</p>
<p>in raiment of the most enchanting beauty.</p>
<p>Thus sang the bard,</p>
<p>and both Ulysses and the seafaring Phaeacians were</p>
<p>charmed as they heard him.</p>
<p>Then Alcinous told Laodamas and Halius to dance alone,</p>
<p>for there was no</p>
<p>one to compete with them. So they took a red ball which Polybus had</p>
<p>made for them,</p>
<p>and one of them bent himself backwards and threw it up</p>
<p>towards the clouds,</p>
<p>while the other jumped from off the ground and</p>
<p>caught it with ease before it came down again. When they had done</p>
<p>throwing the ball straight up into the air they began to dance,</p>
<p>and at</p>
<p>the same time kept on throwing it backwards and forwards to one</p>
<p>another,</p>
<p>while all the young men in the ring applauded and made a great</p>
<p>stamping with their feet. Then Ulysses said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúKing Alcinous,</p>
<p>you said your people were the nimblest dancers in the</p>
<p>world,</p>
<p>and indeed they have proved themselves to be so. I was</p>
<p>astonished as I saw them.‚Äù</p>
<p>The king was delighted at this,</p>
<p>and exclaimed to the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAldermen and town councillors,</p>
<p>our guest seems to be a person of</p>
<p>singular judgement; let us give him such proof of our hospitality as he</p>
<p>may reasonably expect. There are twelve chief men among you,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>counting myself there are thirteen; contribute,</p>
<p>each of you,</p>
<p>a clean</p>
<p>cloak,</p>
<p>a shirt,</p>
<p>and a talent of fine gold; let us give him all this in</p>
<p>a lump down at once,</p>
<p>so that when he gets his supper he may do so with</p>
<p>a light heart. As for Euryalus he will have to make a formal apology</p>
<p>and a present too,</p>
<p>for he has been rude.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak. The others all of them applauded his saying,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>sent their servants to fetch the presents. Then Euryalus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúKing</p>
<p>Alcinous,</p>
<p>I will give the stranger all the satisfaction you require. He</p>
<p>shall have my sword,</p>
<p>which is of bronze,</p>
<p>all but the hilt,</p>
<p>which is of</p>
<p>silver. I will also give him the scabbard of newly sawn ivory into</p>
<p>which it fits. It will be worth a great deal to him.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he placed the sword in the hands of Ulysses and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood</p>
<p>luck to you,</p>
<p>father stranger; if anything has been said amiss may the</p>
<p>winds blow it away with them,</p>
<p>and may heaven grant you a safe return,</p>
<p>for I understand you have been long away from home,</p>
<p>and have gone</p>
<p>through much hardship.‚Äù</p>
<p>To which Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood luck to you too my friend,</p>
<p>and may the</p>
<p>gods grant you every happiness. I hope you will not miss the sword you</p>
<p>have given me along with your apology.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he girded the sword about his shoulders and towards</p>
<p>sundown the presents began to make their appearance,</p>
<p>as the servants of</p>
<p>the donors kept bringing them to the house of King Alcinous; here his</p>
<p>sons received them,</p>
<p>and placed them under their mother‚Äôs charge. Then</p>
<p>Alcinous led the way to the house and bade his guests take their seats.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWife,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>turning to Queen Arete,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo,</p>
<p>fetch the best chest we</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>and put a clean cloak and shirt in it. Also,</p>
<p>set a copper on the</p>
<p>fire and heat some water; our guest will take a warm bath; see also to</p>
<p>the careful packing of the presents that the noble Phaeacians have made</p>
<p>him; he will thus better enjoy both his supper and the singing that</p>
<p>will follow. I shall myself give him this golden goblet‚Äîwhich is of</p>
<p>exquisite workmanship‚Äîthat he may be reminded of me for the rest of his</p>
<p>life whenever he makes a drink offering to Jove,</p>
<p>or to any of the</p>
<p>gods.‚Äù70</p>
<p>Then Arete told her maids to set a large tripod upon the fire as fast</p>
<p>as they could,</p>
<p>whereon they set a tripod full of bath water on to a</p>
<p>clear fire; they threw on sticks to make it blaze,</p>
<p>and the water became</p>
<p>hot as the flame played about the belly of the tripod.71 Meanwhile</p>
<p>Arete brought a magnificent chest from her own room,</p>
<p>and inside it she</p>
<p>packed all the beautiful presents of gold and raiment which the</p>
<p>Phaeacians had brought. Lastly she added a cloak and a good shirt from</p>
<p>Alcinous,</p>
<p>and said to Ulysses:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSee to the lid yourself,</p>
<p>and have the whole bound round at once,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>fear any one should rob you by the way when you are asleep in your</p>
<p>ship.‚Äù 72</p>
<p>When Ulysses heard this he put the lid on the chest and made it fast</p>
<p>with a bond that Circe had taught him. He had done so before an upper</p>
<p>servant told him to come to the bath and wash himself. He was very glad</p>
<p>of a warm bath,</p>
<p>for he had had no one to wait upon him ever since he</p>
<p>left the house of Calypso,</p>
<p>who as long as he remained with her had</p>
<p>taken as good care of him as though he had been a god. When the</p>
<p>servants had done washing and anointing him with oil,</p>
<p>and had given him</p>
<p>a clean cloak and shirt,</p>
<p>he left the bath room and joined the guests</p>
<p>who were sitting over their wine. Lovely Nausicaa stood by one of the</p>
<p>bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,</p>
<p>and admired him as</p>
<p>she saw him pass. ‚ÄúFarewell stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not forget me when</p>
<p>you are safe at home again,</p>
<p>for it is to me first that you owe a ransom</p>
<p>for having saved your life.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNausicaa,</p>
<p>daughter of great Alcinous,</p>
<p>may Jove the</p>
<p>mighty husband of Juno,</p>
<p>grant that I may reach my home; so shall I</p>
<p>bless you as my guardian angel all my days,</p>
<p>for it was you who saved</p>
<p>me.‚Äù</p>
<p>When he had said this,</p>
<p>he seated himself beside Alcinous. Supper was</p>
<p>then served,</p>
<p>and the wine was mixed for drinking. A servant led in the</p>
<p>favourite bard Demodocus,</p>
<p>and set him in the midst of the company,</p>
<p>near</p>
<p>one of the bearing-posts supporting the cloister,</p>
<p>that he might lean</p>
<p>against it. Then Ulysses cut off a piece of roast pork with plenty of</p>
<p>fat (for there was abundance left on the joint) and said to a servant,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake this piece of pork over to Demodocus and tell him to eat it; for</p>
<p>all the pain his lays may cause me I will salute him none the less;</p>
<p>bards are honoured and respected throughout the world,</p>
<p>for the muse</p>
<p>teaches them their songs and loves them.‚Äù</p>
<p>The servant carried the pork in his fingers over to Demodocus,</p>
<p>who took</p>
<p>it and was very much pleased. They then laid their hands on the good</p>
<p>things that were before them,</p>
<p>and as soon as they had had to eat and</p>
<p>drink,</p>
<p>Ulysses said to Demodocus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúDemodocus,</p>
<p>there is no one in the</p>
<p>world whom I admire more than I do you. You must have studied under the</p>
<p>Muse,</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs daughter,</p>
<p>and under Apollo,</p>
<p>so accurately do you sing the</p>
<p>return of the Achaeans with all their sufferings and adventures. If you</p>
<p>were not there yourself,</p>
<p>you must have heard it all from some one who</p>
<p>was. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>change your song and tell us of the wooden horse</p>
<p>which Epeus made with the assistance of Minerva,</p>
<p>and which Ulysses got</p>
<p>by stratagem into the fort of Troy after freighting it with the men who</p>
<p>afterwards sacked the city. If you will sing this tale aright I will</p>
<p>tell all the world how magnificently heaven has endowed you.‚Äù</p>
<p>The bard inspired of heaven took up the story at the point where some</p>
<p>of the Argives set fire to their tents and sailed away while others,</p>
<p>hidden within the horse,</p>
<p>73 were waiting with Ulysses in the Trojan</p>
<p>place of assembly. For the Trojans themselves had drawn the horse into</p>
<p>their fortress,</p>
<p>and it stood there while they sat in council round it,</p>
<p>and were in three minds as to what they should do. Some were for</p>
<p>breaking it up then and there; others would have it dragged to the top</p>
<p>of the rock on which the fortress stood,</p>
<p>and then thrown down the</p>
<p>precipice; while yet others were for letting it remain as an offering</p>
<p>and propitiation for the gods. And this was how they settled it in the</p>
<p>end,</p>
<p>for the city was doomed when it took in that horse,</p>
<p>within which</p>
<p>were all the bravest of the Argives waiting to bring death and</p>
<p>destruction on the Trojans. Anon he sang how the sons of the Achaeans</p>
<p>issued from the horse,</p>
<p>and sacked the town,</p>
<p>breaking out from their</p>
<p>ambuscade. He sang how they overran the city hither and thither and</p>
<p>ravaged it,</p>
<p>and how Ulysses went raging like Mars along with Menelaus</p>
<p>to the house of Deiphobus. It was there that the fight raged most</p>
<p>furiously,</p>
<p>nevertheless by Minerva‚Äôs help he was victorious.</p>
<p>All this he told,</p>
<p>but Ulysses was overcome as he heard him,</p>
<p>and his</p>
<p>cheeks were wet with tears. He wept as a woman weeps when she throws</p>
<p>herself on the body of her husband who has fallen before his own city</p>
<p>and people,</p>
<p>fighting bravely in defence of his home and children. She</p>
<p>screams aloud and flings her arms about him as he lies gasping for</p>
<p>breath and dying,</p>
<p>but her enemies beat her from behind about the back</p>
<p>and shoulders,</p>
<p>and carry her off into slavery,</p>
<p>to a life of labour and</p>
<p>sorrow,</p>
<p>and the beauty fades from her cheeks‚Äîeven so piteously did</p>
<p>Ulysses weep,</p>
<p>but none of those present perceived his tears except</p>
<p>Alcinous,</p>
<p>who was sitting near him,</p>
<p>and could hear the sobs and sighs</p>
<p>that he was heaving. The king,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>at once rose and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAldermen and town councillors of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>let Demodocus cease</p>
<p>his song,</p>
<p>for there are those present who do not seem to like it. From</p>
<p>the moment that we had done supper and Demodocus began to sing,</p>
<p>our</p>
<p>guest has been all the time groaning and lamenting. He is evidently in</p>
<p>great trouble,</p>
<p>so let the bard leave off,</p>
<p>that we may all enjoy</p>
<p>ourselves,</p>
<p>hosts and guest alike. This will be much more as it should</p>
<p>be,</p>
<p>for all these festivities,</p>
<p>with the escort and the presents that we</p>
<p>are making with so much good will are wholly in his honour,</p>
<p>and any one</p>
<p>with even a moderate amount of right feeling knows that he ought to</p>
<p>treat a guest and a suppliant as though he were his own brother.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTherefore,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>do you on your part affect no more concealment nor</p>
<p>reserve in the matter about which I shall ask you; it will be more</p>
<p>polite in you to give me a plain answer; tell me the name by which your</p>
<p>father and mother over yonder used to call you,</p>
<p>and by which you were</p>
<p>known among your neighbours and fellow-citizens. There is no one,</p>
<p>neither rich nor poor,</p>
<p>who is absolutely without any name whatever,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>people‚Äôs fathers and mothers give them names as soon as they are born.</p>
<p>Tell me also your country,</p>
<p>nation,</p>
<p>and city,</p>
<p>that our ships may shape</p>
<p>their purpose accordingly and take you there. For the Phaeacians have</p>
<p>no pilots; their vessels have no rudders as those of other nations</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>but the ships themselves understand what it is that we are</p>
<p>thinking about and want; they know all the cities and countries in the</p>
<p>whole world,</p>
<p>and can traverse the sea just as well even when it is</p>
<p>covered with mist and cloud,</p>
<p>so that there is no danger of being</p>
<p>wrecked or coming to any harm. Still I do remember hearing my father</p>
<p>say that Neptune was angry with us for being too easy-going in the</p>
<p>matter of giving people escorts. He said that one of these days he</p>
<p>should wreck a ship of ours as it was returning from having escorted</p>
<p>some one,</p>
<p>74 and bury our city under a high mountain. This is what my</p>
<p>father used to say,</p>
<p>but whether the god will carry out his threat or no</p>
<p>is a matter which he will decide for himself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd now,</p>
<p>tell me and tell me true. Where have you been wandering,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>in what countries have you travelled? Tell us of the peoples</p>
<p>themselves,</p>
<p>and of their cities‚Äîwho were hostile,</p>
<p>savage and</p>
<p>uncivilised,</p>
<p>and who,</p>
<p>on the other hand,</p>
<p>hospitable and humane. Tell us</p>
<p>also why you are made so unhappy on hearing about the return of the</p>
<p>Argive Danaans from Troy. The gods arranged all this,</p>
<p>and sent them</p>
<p>their misfortunes in order that future generations might have something</p>
<p>to sing about. Did you lose some brave kinsman of your wife‚Äôs when you</p>
<p>were before Troy? a son-in-law or father-in-law‚Äîwhich are the nearest</p>
<p>relations a man has outside his own flesh and blood? or was it some</p>
<p>brave and kindly-natured comrade‚Äîfor a good friend is as dear to a man</p>
<p>as his own brother?‚Äù</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK IX</span>
<p>ULYSSES DECLARES HIMSELF AND BEGINS HIS STORY‚Äî-THE CICONS,</p>
<p>LOTOPHAGI,</p>
<p>AND CYCLOPES.</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúKing Alcinous,</p>
<p>it is a good thing to hear a bard</p>
<p>with such a divine voice as this man has. There is nothing better or</p>
<p>more delightful than when a whole people make merry together,</p>
<p>with the</p>
<p>guests sitting orderly to listen,</p>
<p>while the table is loaded with bread</p>
<p>and meats,</p>
<p>and the cup-bearer draws wine and fills his cup for every</p>
<p>man. This is indeed as fair a sight as a man can see. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>since you are inclined to ask the story of my sorrows,</p>
<p>and rekindle my</p>
<p>own sad memories in respect of them,</p>
<p>I do not know how to begin,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>yet how to continue and conclude my tale,</p>
<p>for the hand of heaven has</p>
<p>been laid heavily upon me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirstly,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>I will tell you my name that you too may know it,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>one day,</p>
<p>if I outlive this time of sorrow,</p>
<p>may become my guests though</p>
<p>I live so far away from all of you. I am Ulysses son of Laertes,</p>
<p>renowned among mankind for all manner of subtlety,</p>
<p>so that my fame</p>
<p>ascends to heaven. I live in Ithaca,</p>
<p>where there is a high mountain</p>
<p>called Neritum,</p>
<p>covered with forests; and not far from it there is a</p>
<p>group of islands very near to one another‚ÄîDulichium,</p>
<p>Same,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>wooded island of Zacynthus. It lies squat on the horizon,</p>
<p>all highest</p>
<p>up in the sea towards the sunset,</p>
<p>while the others lie away from it</p>
<p>towards dawn.75 It is a rugged island,</p>
<p>but it breeds brave men,</p>
<p>and my</p>
<p>eyes know none that they better love to look upon. The goddess Calypso</p>
<p>kept me with her in her cave,</p>
<p>and wanted me to marry her,</p>
<p>as did also</p>
<p>the cunning Aeaean goddess Circe; but they could neither of them</p>
<p>persuade me,</p>
<p>for there is nothing dearer to a man than his own country</p>
<p>and his parents,</p>
<p>and however splendid a home he may have in a foreign</p>
<p>country,</p>
<p>if it be far from father or mother,</p>
<p>he does not care about it.</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I will tell you of the many hazardous adventures which by</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs will I met with on my return from Troy.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I had set sail thence the wind took me first to Ismarus,</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p>the city of the Cicons. There I sacked the town and put the people to</p>
<p>the sword. We took their wives and also much booty,</p>
<p>which we divided</p>
<p>equitably amongst us,</p>
<p>so that none might have reason to complain. I</p>
<p>then said that we had better make off at once,</p>
<p>but my men very</p>
<p>foolishly would not obey me,</p>
<p>so they staid there drinking much wine and</p>
<p>killing great numbers of sheep and oxen on the sea shore. Meanwhile the</p>
<p>Cicons cried out for help to other Cicons who lived inland. These were</p>
<p>more in number,</p>
<p>and stronger,</p>
<p>and they were more skilled in the art of</p>
<p>war,</p>
<p>for they could fight,</p>
<p>either from chariots or on foot as the</p>
<p>occasion served; in the morning,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>they came as thick as</p>
<p>leaves and bloom in summer,</p>
<p>and the hand of heaven was against us,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that we were hard pressed. They set the battle in array near the ships,</p>
<p>and the hosts aimed their bronze-shod spears at one another.76 So long</p>
<p>as the day waxed and it was still morning,</p>
<p>we held our own against</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>though they were more in number than we; but as the sun went</p>
<p>down,</p>
<p>towards the time when men loose their oxen,</p>
<p>the Cicons got the</p>
<p>better of us,</p>
<p>and we lost half a dozen men from every ship we had; so</p>
<p>we got away with those that were left.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThence we sailed onward with sorrow in our hearts,</p>
<p>but glad to have</p>
<p>escaped death though we had lost our comrades,</p>
<p>nor did we leave till we</p>
<p>had thrice invoked each one of the poor fellows who had perished by the</p>
<p>hands of the Cicons. Then Jove raised the North wind against us till it</p>
<p>blew a hurricane,</p>
<p>so that land and sky were hidden in thick clouds,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>night sprang forth out of the heavens. We let the ships run before the</p>
<p>gale,</p>
<p>but the force of the wind tore our sails to tatters,</p>
<p>so we took</p>
<p>them down for fear of shipwreck,</p>
<p>and rowed our hardest towards the</p>
<p>land. There we lay two days and two nights suffering much alike from</p>
<p>toil and distress of mind,</p>
<p>but on the morning of the third day we again</p>
<p>raised our masts,</p>
<p>set sail,</p>
<p>and took our places,</p>
<p>letting the wind and</p>
<p>steersmen direct our ship. I should have got home at that time unharmed</p>
<p>had not the North wind and the currents been against me as I was</p>
<p>doubling Cape Malea,</p>
<p>and set me off my course hard by the island of</p>
<p>Cythera.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was driven thence by foul winds for a space of nine days upon the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>but on the tenth day we reached the land of the Lotus-eaters,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>live on a food that comes from a kind of flower. Here we landed to take</p>
<p>in fresh water,</p>
<p>and our crews got their mid-day meal on the shore near</p>
<p>the ships. When they had eaten and drunk I sent two of my company to</p>
<p>see what manner of men the people of the place might be,</p>
<p>and they had a</p>
<p>third man under them. They started at once,</p>
<p>and went about among the</p>
<p>Lotus-eaters,</p>
<p>who did them no hurt,</p>
<p>but gave them to eat of the lotus,</p>
<p>which was so delicious that those who ate of it left off caring about</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>and did not even want to go back and say what had happened to</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>but were for staying and munching lotus77 with the Lotus-eaters</p>
<p>without thinking further of their return; nevertheless,</p>
<p>though they</p>
<p>wept bitterly I forced them back to the ships and made them fast under</p>
<p>the benches. Then I told the rest to go on board at once,</p>
<p>lest any of</p>
<p>them should taste of the lotus and leave off wanting to get home,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe sailed hence,</p>
<p>always in much distress,</p>
<p>till we came to the land of</p>
<p>the lawless and inhuman Cyclopes. Now the Cyclopes neither plant nor</p>
<p>plough,</p>
<p>but trust in providence,</p>
<p>and live on such wheat,</p>
<p>barley,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>grapes as grow wild without any kind of tillage,</p>
<p>and their wild grapes</p>
<p>yield them wine as the sun and the rain may grow them. They have no</p>
<p>laws nor assemblies of the people,</p>
<p>but live in caves on the tops of</p>
<p>high mountains; each is lord and master in his family,</p>
<p>and they take no</p>
<p>account of their neighbours.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow off their harbour there lies a wooded and fertile island not quite</p>
<p>close to the land of the Cyclopes,</p>
<p>but still not far. It is over-run</p>
<p>with wild goats,</p>
<p>that breed there in great numbers and are never</p>
<p>disturbed by foot of man; for sportsmen‚Äîwho as a rule will suffer so</p>
<p>much hardship in forest or among mountain precipices‚Äîdo not go there,</p>
<p>nor yet again is it ever ploughed or fed down,</p>
<p>but it lies a wilderness</p>
<p>untilled and unsown from year to year,</p>
<p>and has no living thing upon it</p>
<p>but only goats. For the Cyclopes have no ships,</p>
<p>nor yet shipwrights who</p>
<p>could make ships for them; they cannot therefore go from city to city,</p>
<p>or sail over the sea to one another‚Äôs country as people who have ships</p>
<p>can do; if they had had these they would have colonised the island,</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>for it is a very good one,</p>
<p>and would yield everything in due season.</p>
<p>There are meadows that in some places come right down to the sea shore,</p>
<p>well watered and full of luscious grass; grapes would do there</p>
<p>excellently; there is level land for ploughing,</p>
<p>and it would always</p>
<p>yield heavily at harvest time,</p>
<p>for the soil is deep. There is a good</p>
<p>harbour where no cables are wanted,</p>
<p>nor yet anchors,</p>
<p>nor need a ship be</p>
<p>moored,</p>
<p>but all one has to do is to beach one‚Äôs vessel and stay there</p>
<p>till the wind becomes fair for putting out to sea again. At the head of</p>
<p>the harbour there is a spring of clear water coming out of a cave,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>there are poplars growing all round it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere we entered,</p>
<p>but so dark was the night that some god must have</p>
<p>brought us in,</p>
<p>for there was nothing whatever to be seen. A thick mist</p>
<p>hung all round our ships;79 the moon was hidden behind a mass of clouds</p>
<p>so that no one could have seen the island if he had looked for it,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>were there any breakers to tell us we were close in shore before we</p>
<p>found ourselves upon the land itself; when,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>we had beached the</p>
<p>ships,</p>
<p>we took down the sails,</p>
<p>went ashore and camped upon the beach</p>
<p>till daybreak.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>we admired the</p>
<p>island and wandered all over it,</p>
<p>while the nymphs Jove‚Äôs daughters</p>
<p>roused the wild goats that we might get some meat for our dinner. On</p>
<p>this we fetched our spears and bows and arrows from the ships,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>dividing ourselves into three bands began to shoot the goats. Heaven</p>
<p>sent us excellent sport; I had twelve ships with me,</p>
<p>and each ship got</p>
<p>nine goats,</p>
<p>while my own ship had ten; thus through the livelong day to</p>
<p>the going down of the sun we ate and drank our fill,</p>
<p>and we had plenty</p>
<p>of wine left,</p>
<p>for each one of us had taken many jars full when we</p>
<p>sacked the city of the Cicons,</p>
<p>and this had not yet run out. While we</p>
<p>were feasting we kept turning our eyes towards the land of the</p>
<p>Cyclopes,</p>
<p>which was hard by,</p>
<p>and saw the smoke of their stubble fires.</p>
<p>We could almost fancy we heard their voices and the bleating of their</p>
<p>sheep and goats,</p>
<p>but when the sun went down and it came on dark,</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>camped down upon the beach,</p>
<p>and next morning I called a council.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòStay here,</p>
<p>my brave fellows,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòall the rest of you,</p>
<p>while I</p>
<p>go with my ship and exploit these people myself: I want to see if they</p>
<p>are uncivilised savages,</p>
<p>or a hospitable and humane race.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI went on board,</p>
<p>bidding my men to do so also and loose the hawsers;</p>
<p>so they took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars. When</p>
<p>we got to the land,</p>
<p>which was not far,</p>
<p>there,</p>
<p>on the face of a cliff</p>
<p>near the sea,</p>
<p>we saw a great cave overhung with laurels. It was a</p>
<p>station for a great many sheep and goats,</p>
<p>and outside there was a large</p>
<p>yard,</p>
<p>with a high wall round it made of stones built into the ground</p>
<p>and of trees both pine and oak. This was the abode of a huge monster</p>
<p>who was then away from home shepherding his flocks. He would have</p>
<p>nothing to do with other people,</p>
<p>but led the life of an outlaw. He was</p>
<p>a horrid creature,</p>
<p>not like a human being at all,</p>
<p>but resembling rather</p>
<p>some crag that stands out boldly against the sky on the top of a high</p>
<p>mountain.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI told my men to draw the ship ashore,</p>
<p>and stay where they were,</p>
<p>all</p>
<p>but the twelve best among them,</p>
<p>who were to go along with myself. I</p>
<p>also took a goatskin of sweet black wine which had been given me by</p>
<p>Maron,</p>
<p>son of Euanthes,</p>
<p>who was priest of Apollo the patron god of</p>
<p>Ismarus,</p>
<p>and lived within the wooded precincts of the temple. When we</p>
<p>were sacking the city we respected him,</p>
<p>and spared his life,</p>
<p>as also</p>
<p>his wife and child; so he made me some presents of great value‚Äîseven</p>
<p>talents of fine gold,</p>
<p>and a bowl of silver,</p>
<p>with twelve jars of sweet</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>unblended,</p>
<p>and of the most exquisite flavour. Not a man nor maid</p>
<p>in the house knew about it,</p>
<p>but only himself,</p>
<p>his wife,</p>
<p>and one</p>
<p>housekeeper: when he drank it he mixed twenty parts of water to one of</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>and yet the fragrance from the mixing-bowl was so exquisite that</p>
<p>it was impossible to refrain from drinking. I filled a large skin with</p>
<p>this wine,</p>
<p>and took a wallet full of provisions with me,</p>
<p>for my mind</p>
<p>misgave me that I might have to deal with some savage who would be of</p>
<p>great strength,</p>
<p>and would respect neither right nor law.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe soon reached his cave,</p>
<p>but he was out shepherding,</p>
<p>so we went</p>
<p>inside and took stock of all that we could see. His cheese-racks were</p>
<p>loaded with cheeses,</p>
<p>and he had more lambs and kids than his pens could</p>
<p>hold. They were kept in separate flocks; first there were the hoggets,</p>
<p>then the oldest of the younger lambs and lastly the very young ones80</p>
<p>all kept apart from one another; as for his dairy,</p>
<p>all the vessels,</p>
<p>bowls,</p>
<p>and milk pails into which he milked,</p>
<p>were swimming with whey.</p>
<p>When they saw all this,</p>
<p>my men begged me to let them first steal some</p>
<p>cheeses,</p>
<p>and make off with them to the ship; they would then return,</p>
<p>drive down the lambs and kids,</p>
<p>put them on board and sail away with</p>
<p>them. It would have been indeed better if we had done so but I would</p>
<p>not listen to them,</p>
<p>for I wanted to see the owner himself,</p>
<p>in the hope</p>
<p>that he might give me a present. When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>we saw him my poor men</p>
<p>found him ill to deal with.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe lit a fire,</p>
<p>offered some of the cheeses in sacrifice,</p>
<p>ate others of</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>and then sat waiting till the Cyclops should come in with his</p>
<p>sheep. When he came,</p>
<p>he brought in with him a huge load of dry firewood</p>
<p>to light the fire for his supper,</p>
<p>and this he flung with such a noise</p>
<p>on to the floor of his cave that we hid ourselves for fear at the far</p>
<p>end of the cavern. Meanwhile he drove all the ewes inside,</p>
<p>as well as</p>
<p>the she-goats that he was going to milk,</p>
<p>leaving the males,</p>
<p>both rams</p>
<p>and he-goats,</p>
<p>outside in the yards. Then he rolled a huge stone to the</p>
<p>mouth of the cave‚Äîso huge that two and twenty strong four-wheeled</p>
<p>waggons would not be enough to draw it from its place against the</p>
<p>doorway. When he had so done he sat down and milked his ewes and goats,</p>
<p>all in due course,</p>
<p>and then let each of them have her own young. He</p>
<p>curdled half the milk and set it aside in wicker strainers,</p>
<p>but the</p>
<p>other half he poured into bowls that he might drink it for his supper.</p>
<p>When he had got through with all his work,</p>
<p>he lit the fire,</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>caught sight of us,</p>
<p>whereon he said:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòStrangers,</p>
<p>who are you? Where do sail from? Are you traders,</p>
<p>or do</p>
<p>you sail the sea as rovers,</p>
<p>with your hands against every man,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>every man‚Äôs hand against you?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe were frightened out of our senses by his loud voice and monstrous</p>
<p>form,</p>
<p>but I managed to say,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWe are Achaeans on our way home from Troy,</p>
<p>but by the will of Jove,</p>
<p>and stress of weather,</p>
<p>we have been driven far</p>
<p>out of our course. We are the people of Agamemnon,</p>
<p>son of Atreus,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>has won infinite renown throughout the whole world,</p>
<p>by sacking so great</p>
<p>a city and killing so many people. We therefore humbly pray you to show</p>
<p>us some hospitality,</p>
<p>and otherwise make us such presents as visitors</p>
<p>may reasonably expect. May your excellency fear the wrath of heaven,</p>
<p>for we are your suppliants,</p>
<p>and Jove takes all respectable travellers</p>
<p>under his protection,</p>
<p>for he is the avenger of all suppliants and</p>
<p>foreigners in distress.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúTo this he gave me but a pitiless answer,</p>
<p>‚ÄòStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚Äòyou</p>
<p>are a fool,</p>
<p>or else you know nothing of this country. Talk to me,</p>
<p>indeed,</p>
<p>about fearing the gods or shunning their anger? We Cyclopes do</p>
<p>not care about Jove or any of your blessed gods,</p>
<p>for we are ever so</p>
<p>much stronger than they. I shall not spare either yourself or your</p>
<p>companions out of any regard for Jove,</p>
<p>unless I am in the humour for</p>
<p>doing so. And now tell me where you made your ship fast when you came</p>
<p>on shore. Was it round the point,</p>
<p>or is she lying straight off the</p>
<p>land?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe said this to draw me out,</p>
<p>but I was too cunning to be caught in</p>
<p>that way,</p>
<p>so I answered with a lie; ‚ÄòNeptune,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòsent my ship on</p>
<p>to the rocks at the far end of your country,</p>
<p>and wrecked it. We were</p>
<p>driven on to them from the open sea,</p>
<p>but I and those who are with me</p>
<p>escaped the jaws of death.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe cruel wretch vouchsafed me not one word of answer,</p>
<p>but with a</p>
<p>sudden clutch he gripped up two of my men at once and dashed them down</p>
<p>upon the ground as though they had been puppies. Their brains were shed</p>
<p>upon the ground,</p>
<p>and the earth was wet with their blood. Then he tore</p>
<p>them limb from limb and supped upon them. He gobbled them up like a</p>
<p>lion in the wilderness,</p>
<p>flesh,</p>
<p>bones,</p>
<p>marrow,</p>
<p>and entrails,</p>
<p>without</p>
<p>leaving anything uneaten. As for us,</p>
<p>we wept and lifted up our hands to</p>
<p>heaven on seeing such a horrid sight,</p>
<p>for we did not know what else to</p>
<p>do; but when the Cyclops had filled his huge paunch,</p>
<p>and had washed</p>
<p>down his meal of human flesh with a drink of neat milk,</p>
<p>he stretched</p>
<p>himself full length upon the ground among his sheep,</p>
<p>and went to sleep.</p>
<p>I was at first inclined to seize my sword,</p>
<p>draw it,</p>
<p>and drive it into</p>
<p>his vitals,</p>
<p>but I reflected that if I did we should all certainly be</p>
<p>lost,</p>
<p>for we should never be able to shift the stone which the monster</p>
<p>had put in front of the door. So we stayed sobbing and sighing where we</p>
<p>were till morning came.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>he again lit</p>
<p>his fire,</p>
<p>milked his goats and ewes,</p>
<p>all quite rightly,</p>
<p>and then let</p>
<p>each have her own young one; as soon as he had got through with all his</p>
<p>work,</p>
<p>he clutched up two more of my men,</p>
<p>and began eating them for his</p>
<p>morning‚Äôs meal. Presently,</p>
<p>with the utmost ease,</p>
<p>he rolled the stone</p>
<p>away from the door and drove out his sheep,</p>
<p>but he at once put it back</p>
<p>again‚Äîas easily as though he were merely clapping the lid on to a</p>
<p>quiver full of arrows. As soon as he had done so he shouted,</p>
<p>and cried</p>
<p>‚ÄòShoo,</p>
<p>shoo,</p>
<p>‚Äô after his sheep to drive them on to the mountain; so I</p>
<p>was left to scheme some way of taking my revenge and covering myself</p>
<p>with glory.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the end I deemed it would be the best plan to do as follows: The</p>
<p>Cyclops had a great club which was lying near one of the sheep pens; it</p>
<p>was of green olive wood,</p>
<p>and he had cut it intending to use it for a</p>
<p>staff as soon as it should be dry. It was so huge that we could only</p>
<p>compare it to the mast of a twenty-oared merchant vessel of large</p>
<p>burden,</p>
<p>and able to venture out into open sea. I went up to this club</p>
<p>and cut off about six feet of it; I then gave this piece to the men and</p>
<p>told them to fine it evenly off at one end,</p>
<p>which they proceeded to do,</p>
<p>and lastly I brought it to a point myself,</p>
<p>charring the end in the fire</p>
<p>to make it harder. When I had done this I hid it under dung,</p>
<p>which was</p>
<p>lying about all over the cave,</p>
<p>and told the men to cast lots which of</p>
<p>them should venture along with myself to lift it and bore it into the</p>
<p>monster‚Äôs eye while he was asleep. The lot fell upon the very four whom</p>
<p>I should have chosen,</p>
<p>and I myself made five. In the evening the wretch</p>
<p>came back from shepherding,</p>
<p>and drove his flocks into the cave‚Äîthis</p>
<p>time driving them all inside,</p>
<p>and not leaving any in the yards; I</p>
<p>suppose some fancy must have taken him,</p>
<p>or a god must have prompted him</p>
<p>to do so. As soon as he had put the stone back to its place against the</p>
<p>door,</p>
<p>he sat down,</p>
<p>milked his ewes and his goats all quite rightly,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>then let each have her own young one; when he had got through with all</p>
<p>this work,</p>
<p>he gripped up two more of my men,</p>
<p>and made his supper off</p>
<p>them. So I went up to him with an ivy-wood bowl of black wine in my</p>
<p>hands:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòLook here,</p>
<p>Cyclops,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>you have been eating a great deal of</p>
<p>man‚Äôs flesh,</p>
<p>so take this and drink some wine,</p>
<p>that you may see what</p>
<p>kind of liquor we had on board my ship. I was bringing it to you as a</p>
<p>drink-offering,</p>
<p>in the hope that you would take compassion upon me and</p>
<p>further me on my way home,</p>
<p>whereas all you do is to go on ramping and</p>
<p>raving most intolerably. You ought to be ashamed of yourself; how can</p>
<p>you expect people to come see you any more if you treat them in this</p>
<p>way?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe then took the cup and drank. He was so delighted with the taste of</p>
<p>the wine that he begged me for another bowl full. ‚ÄòBe so kind,</p>
<p>‚Äô he</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚Äòas to give me some more,</p>
<p>and tell me your name at once. I want</p>
<p>to make you a present that you will be glad to have. We have wine even</p>
<p>in this country,</p>
<p>for our soil grows grapes and the sun ripens them,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>this drinks like Nectar and Ambrosia all in one.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI then gave him some more; three times did I fill the bowl for him,</p>
<p>and three times did he drain it without thought or heed; then,</p>
<p>when I</p>
<p>saw that the wine had got into his head,</p>
<p>I said to him as plausibly as</p>
<p>I could: ‚ÄòCyclops,</p>
<p>you ask my name and I will tell it you; give me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>the present you promised me; my name is Noman; this is what</p>
<p>my father and mother and my friends have always called me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the cruel wretch said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòThen I will eat all Noman‚Äôs comrades</p>
<p>before Noman himself,</p>
<p>and will keep Noman for the last. This is the</p>
<p>present that I will make him.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs he spoke he reeled,</p>
<p>and fell sprawling face upwards on the ground.</p>
<p>His great neck hung heavily backwards and a deep sleep took hold upon</p>
<p>him. Presently he turned sick,</p>
<p>and threw up both wine and the gobbets</p>
<p>of human flesh on which he had been gorging,</p>
<p>for he was very drunk.</p>
<p>Then I thrust the beam of wood far into the embers to heat it,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>encouraged my men lest any of them should turn faint-hearted. When the</p>
<p>wood,</p>
<p>green though it was,</p>
<p>was about to blaze,</p>
<p>I drew it out of the</p>
<p>fire glowing with heat,</p>
<p>and my men gathered round me,</p>
<p>for heaven had</p>
<p>filled their hearts with courage. We drove the sharp end of the beam</p>
<p>into the monster‚Äôs eye,</p>
<p>and bearing upon it with all my weight I kept</p>
<p>turning it round and round as though I were boring a hole in a ship‚Äôs</p>
<p>plank with an auger,</p>
<p>which two men with a wheel and strap can keep on</p>
<p>turning as long as they choose. Even thus did we bore the red hot beam</p>
<p>into his eye,</p>
<p>till the boiling blood bubbled all over it as we worked</p>
<p>it round and round,</p>
<p>so that the steam from the burning eyeball scalded</p>
<p>his eyelids and eyebrows,</p>
<p>and the roots of the eye sputtered in the</p>
<p>fire. As a blacksmith plunges an axe or hatchet into cold water to</p>
<p>temper it‚Äîfor it is this that gives strength to the iron‚Äîand it makes a</p>
<p>great hiss as he does so,</p>
<p>even thus did the Cyclops‚Äô eye hiss round the</p>
<p>beam of olive wood,</p>
<p>and his hideous yells made the cave ring again. We</p>
<p>ran away in a fright,</p>
<p>but he plucked the beam all besmirched with gore</p>
<p>from his eye,</p>
<p>and hurled it from him in a frenzy of rage and pain,</p>
<p>shouting as he did so to the other Cyclopes who lived on the bleak</p>
<p>headlands near him; so they gathered from all quarters round his cave</p>
<p>when they heard him crying,</p>
<p>and asked what was the matter with him.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWhat ails you,</p>
<p>Polyphemus,</p>
<p>‚Äô said they,</p>
<p>‚Äòthat you make such a noise,</p>
<p>breaking the stillness of the night,</p>
<p>and preventing us from being able</p>
<p>to sleep? Surely no man is carrying off your sheep? Surely no man is</p>
<p>trying to kill you either by fraud or by force?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut Polyphemus shouted to them from inside the cave,</p>
<p>‚ÄòNoman is killing</p>
<p>me by fraud; no man is killing me by force.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòThen,</p>
<p>‚Äô said they,</p>
<p>‚Äòif no man is attacking you,</p>
<p>you must be ill; when</p>
<p>Jove makes people ill,</p>
<p>there is no help for it,</p>
<p>and you had better pray</p>
<p>to your father Neptune.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen they went away,</p>
<p>and I laughed inwardly at the success of my</p>
<p>clever stratagem,</p>
<p>but the Cyclops,</p>
<p>groaning and in an agony of pain,</p>
<p>felt about with his hands till he found the stone and took it from the</p>
<p>door; then he sat in the doorway and stretched his hands in front of it</p>
<p>to catch anyone going out with the sheep,</p>
<p>for he thought I might be</p>
<p>foolish enough to attempt this.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs for myself I kept on puzzling to think how I could best save my own</p>
<p>life and those of my companions; I schemed and schemed,</p>
<p>as one who</p>
<p>knows that his life depends upon it,</p>
<p>for the danger was very great. In</p>
<p>the end I deemed that this plan would be the best; the male sheep were</p>
<p>well grown,</p>
<p>and carried a heavy black fleece,</p>
<p>so I bound them</p>
<p>noiselessly in threes together,</p>
<p>with some of the withies on which the</p>
<p>wicked monster used to sleep. There was to be a man under the middle</p>
<p>sheep,</p>
<p>and the two on either side were to cover him,</p>
<p>so that there were</p>
<p>three sheep to each man. As for myself there was a ram finer than any</p>
<p>of the others,</p>
<p>so I caught hold of him by the back,</p>
<p>esconced myself in</p>
<p>the thick wool under his belly,</p>
<p>and hung on patiently to his fleece,</p>
<p>face upwards,</p>
<p>keeping a firm hold on it all the time.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>did we wait in great fear of mind till morning came,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>when the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>the male sheep</p>
<p>hurried out to feed,</p>
<p>while the ewes remained bleating about the pens</p>
<p>waiting to be milked,</p>
<p>for their udders were full to bursting; but their</p>
<p>master in spite of all his pain felt the backs of all the sheep as they</p>
<p>stood upright,</p>
<p>without being sharp enough to find out that the men were</p>
<p>underneath their bellies. As the ram was going out,</p>
<p>last of all,</p>
<p>heavy</p>
<p>with its fleece and with the weight of my crafty self,</p>
<p>Polyphemus laid</p>
<p>hold of it and said:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMy good ram,</p>
<p>what is it that makes you the last to leave my cave this</p>
<p>morning? You are not wont to let the ewes go before you,</p>
<p>but lead the</p>
<p>mob with a run whether to flowery mead or bubbling fountain,</p>
<p>and are</p>
<p>the first to come home again at night; but now you lag last of all. Is</p>
<p>it because you know your master has lost his eye,</p>
<p>and are sorry because</p>
<p>that wicked Noman and his horrid crew has got him down in his drink and</p>
<p>blinded him? But I will have his life yet. If you could understand and</p>
<p>talk,</p>
<p>you would tell me where the wretch is hiding,</p>
<p>and I would dash</p>
<p>his brains upon the ground till they flew all over the cave. I should</p>
<p>thus have some satisfaction for the harm this no-good Noman has done</p>
<p>me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs he spoke he drove the ram outside,</p>
<p>but when we were a little way</p>
<p>out from the cave and yards,</p>
<p>I first got from under the ram‚Äôs belly,</p>
<p>and then freed my comrades; as for the sheep,</p>
<p>which were very fat,</p>
<p>by</p>
<p>constantly heading them in the right direction we managed to drive them</p>
<p>down to the ship. The crew rejoiced greatly at seeing those of us who</p>
<p>had escaped death,</p>
<p>but wept for the others whom the Cyclops had killed.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>I made signs to them by nodding and frowning that they were to</p>
<p>hush their crying,</p>
<p>and told them to get all the sheep on board at once</p>
<p>and put out to sea; so they went aboard,</p>
<p>took their places,</p>
<p>and smote</p>
<p>the grey sea with their oars. Then,</p>
<p>when I had got as far out as my</p>
<p>voice would reach,</p>
<p>I began to jeer at the Cyclops.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòCyclops,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòyou should have taken better measure of your man</p>
<p>before eating up his comrades in your cave. You wretch,</p>
<p>eat up your</p>
<p>visitors in your own house? You might have known that your sin would</p>
<p>find you out,</p>
<p>and now Jove and the other gods have punished you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe got more and more furious as he heard me,</p>
<p>so he tore the top from</p>
<p>off a high mountain,</p>
<p>and flung it just in front of my ship so that it</p>
<p>was within a little of hitting the end of the rudder.81 The sea quaked</p>
<p>as the rock fell into it,</p>
<p>and the wash of the wave it raised carried us</p>
<p>back towards the mainland,</p>
<p>and forced us towards the shore. But I</p>
<p>snatched up a long pole and kept the ship off,</p>
<p>making signs to my men</p>
<p>by nodding my head,</p>
<p>that they must row for their lives,</p>
<p>whereon they</p>
<p>laid out with a will. When we had got twice as far as we were before,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>was for jeering at the Cyclops again,</p>
<p>but the men begged and prayed of</p>
<p>me to hold my tongue.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòDo not,</p>
<p>‚Äô they exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äòbe mad enough to provoke this savage</p>
<p>creature further; he has thrown one rock at us already which drove us</p>
<p>back again to the mainland,</p>
<p>and we made sure it had been the death of</p>
<p>us; if he had then heard any further sound of voices he would have</p>
<p>pounded our heads and our ship‚Äôs timbers into a jelly with the rugged</p>
<p>rocks he would have heaved at us,</p>
<p>for he can throw them a long way.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I would not listen to them,</p>
<p>and shouted out to him in my rage,</p>
<p>‚ÄòCyclops,</p>
<p>if any one asks you who it was that put your eye out and</p>
<p>spoiled your beauty,</p>
<p>say it was the valiant warrior Ulysses,</p>
<p>son of</p>
<p>Laertes,</p>
<p>who lives in Ithaca.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this he groaned,</p>
<p>and cried out,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAlas,</p>
<p>alas,</p>
<p>then the old prophecy</p>
<p>about me is coming true. There was a prophet here,</p>
<p>at one time,</p>
<p>a man</p>
<p>both brave and of great stature,</p>
<p>Telemus son of Eurymus,</p>
<p>who was an</p>
<p>excellent seer,</p>
<p>and did all the prophesying for the Cyclopes till he</p>
<p>grew old; he told me that all this would happen to me some day,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>said I should lose my sight by the hand of Ulysses. I have been all</p>
<p>along expecting some one of imposing presence and superhuman strength,</p>
<p>whereas he turns out to be a little insignificant weakling,</p>
<p>who has</p>
<p>managed to blind my eye by taking advantage of me in my drink; come</p>
<p>here,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>that I may make you presents to show my</p>
<p>hospitality,</p>
<p>and urge Neptune to help you forward on your journey‚Äîfor</p>
<p>Neptune and I are father and son. He,</p>
<p>if he so will,</p>
<p>shall heal me,</p>
<p>which no one else neither god nor man can do.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI wish I could be as sure of killing you outright and</p>
<p>sending you down to the house of Hades,</p>
<p>as I am that it will take more</p>
<p>than Neptune to cure that eye of yours.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this he lifted up his hands to the firmament of heaven and prayed,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòHear me,</p>
<p>great Neptune; if I am indeed your own true begotten</p>
<p>son,</p>
<p>grant that Ulysses may never reach his home alive; or if he must</p>
<p>get back to his friends at last,</p>
<p>let him do so late and in sore plight</p>
<p>after losing all his men [let him reach his home in another man‚Äôs ship</p>
<p>and find trouble in his house.‚Äô82</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus did he pray,</p>
<p>and Neptune heard his prayer. Then he picked up a</p>
<p>rock much larger than the first,</p>
<p>swung it aloft and hurled it with</p>
<p>prodigious force. It fell just short of the ship,</p>
<p>but was within a</p>
<p>little of hitting the end of the rudder. The sea quaked as the rock</p>
<p>fell into it,</p>
<p>and the wash of the wave it raised drove us onwards on</p>
<p>our way towards the shore of the island.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen at last we got to the island where we had left the rest of our</p>
<p>ships,</p>
<p>we found our comrades lamenting us,</p>
<p>and anxiously awaiting our</p>
<p>return. We ran our vessel upon the sands and got out of her on to the</p>
<p>sea shore; we also landed the Cyclops‚Äô sheep,</p>
<p>and divided them</p>
<p>equitably amongst us so that none might have reason to complain. As for</p>
<p>the ram,</p>
<p>my companions agreed that I should have it as an extra share;</p>
<p>so I sacrificed it on the sea shore,</p>
<p>and burned its thigh bones to</p>
<p>Jove,</p>
<p>who is the lord of all. But he heeded not my sacrifice,</p>
<p>and only</p>
<p>thought how he might destroy both my ships and my comrades.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we feasted</p>
<p>our fill on meat and drink,</p>
<p>but when the sun went down and it came on</p>
<p>dark,</p>
<p>we camped upon the beach. When the child of morning rosy-fingered</p>
<p>Dawn appeared,</p>
<p>I bade my men on board and loose the hawsers. Then they</p>
<p>took their places and smote the grey sea with their oars; so we sailed</p>
<p>on with sorrow in our hearts,</p>
<p>but glad to have escaped death though we</p>
<p>had lost our comrades.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK X</span>
<p>AEOLUS,</p>
<p>THE LAESTRYGONES,</p>
<p>CIRCE.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThence we went on to the Aeolian island where lives Aeolus son of</p>
<p>Hippotas,</p>
<p>dear to the immortal gods. It is an island that floats (as it</p>
<p>were) upon the sea,</p>
<p>83 iron bound with a wall that girds it. Now,</p>
<p>Aeolus</p>
<p>has six daughters and six lusty sons,</p>
<p>so he made the sons marry the</p>
<p>daughters,</p>
<p>and they all live with their dear father and mother,</p>
<p>feasting and enjoying every conceivable kind of luxury. All day long</p>
<p>the atmosphere of the house is loaded with the savour of roasting meats</p>
<p>till it groans again,</p>
<p>yard and all; but by night they sleep on their</p>
<p>well made bedsteads,</p>
<p>each with his own wife between the blankets. These</p>
<p>were the people among whom we had now come.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAeolus entertained me for a whole month asking me questions all the</p>
<p>time about Troy,</p>
<p>the Argive fleet,</p>
<p>and the return of the Achaeans. I</p>
<p>told him exactly how everything had happened,</p>
<p>and when I said I must</p>
<p>go,</p>
<p>and asked him to further me on my way,</p>
<p>he made no sort of</p>
<p>difficulty,</p>
<p>but set about doing so at once. Moreover,</p>
<p>he flayed me a</p>
<p>prime ox-hide to hold the ways of the roaring winds,</p>
<p>which he shut up</p>
<p>in the hide as in a sack‚Äîfor Jove had made him captain over the winds,</p>
<p>and he could stir or still each one of them according to his own</p>
<p>pleasure. He put the sack in the ship and bound the mouth so tightly</p>
<p>with a silver thread that not even a breath of a side-wind could blow</p>
<p>from any quarter. The West wind which was fair for us did he alone let</p>
<p>blow as it chose; but it all came to nothing,</p>
<p>for we were lost through</p>
<p>our own folly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNine days and nine nights did we sail,</p>
<p>and on the tenth day our native</p>
<p>land showed on the horizon. We got so close in that we could see the</p>
<p>stubble fires burning,</p>
<p>and I,</p>
<p>being then dead beat,</p>
<p>fell into a light</p>
<p>sleep,</p>
<p>for I had never let the rudder out of my own hands,</p>
<p>that we</p>
<p>might get home the faster. On this the men fell to talking among</p>
<p>themselves,</p>
<p>and said I was bringing back gold and silver in the sack</p>
<p>that Aeolus had given me. ‚ÄòBless my heart,</p>
<p>‚Äô would one turn to his</p>
<p>neighbour,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚Äòhow this man gets honoured and makes friends to</p>
<p>whatever city or country he may go. See what fine prizes he is taking</p>
<p>home from Troy,</p>
<p>while we,</p>
<p>who have travelled just as far as he has,</p>
<p>come back with hands as empty as we set out with‚Äîand now Aeolus has</p>
<p>given him ever so much more. Quick‚Äîlet us see what it all is,</p>
<p>and how</p>
<p>much gold and silver there is in the sack he gave him.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus they talked and evil counsels prevailed. They loosed the sack,</p>
<p>whereupon the wind flew howling forth and raised a storm that carried</p>
<p>us weeping out to sea and away from our own country. Then I awoke,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>knew not whether to throw myself into the sea or to live on and make</p>
<p>the best of it; but I bore it,</p>
<p>covered myself up,</p>
<p>and lay down in the</p>
<p>ship,</p>
<p>while the men lamented bitterly as the fierce winds bore our</p>
<p>fleet back to the Aeolian island.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we reached it we went ashore to take in water,</p>
<p>and dined hard by</p>
<p>the ships. Immediately after dinner I took a herald and one of my men</p>
<p>and went straight to the house of Aeolus,</p>
<p>where I found him feasting</p>
<p>with his wife and family; so we sat down as suppliants on the</p>
<p>threshold. They were astounded when they saw us and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>what brings you here? What god has been ill-treating you? We took great</p>
<p>pains to further you on your way home to Ithaca,</p>
<p>or wherever it was</p>
<p>that you wanted to go to.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus did they speak,</p>
<p>but I answered sorrowfully,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy men have undone</p>
<p>me; they,</p>
<p>and cruel sleep,</p>
<p>have ruined me. My friends,</p>
<p>mend me this</p>
<p>mischief,</p>
<p>for you can if you will.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI spoke as movingly as I could,</p>
<p>but they said nothing,</p>
<p>till their</p>
<p>father answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄòVilest of mankind,</p>
<p>get you gone at once out of the</p>
<p>island; him whom heaven hates will I in no wise help. Be off,</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>come here as one abhorred of heaven.‚Äô And with these words he sent me</p>
<p>sorrowing from his door.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThence we sailed sadly on till the men were worn out with long and</p>
<p>fruitless rowing,</p>
<p>for there was no longer any wind to help them. Six</p>
<p>days,</p>
<p>night and day did we toil,</p>
<p>and on the seventh day we reached the</p>
<p>rocky stronghold of Lamus‚ÄîTelepylus,</p>
<p>the city of the Laestrygonians,</p>
<p>where the shepherd who is driving in his sheep and goats [to be milked]</p>
<p>salutes him who is driving out his flock [to feed] and this last</p>
<p>answers the salute. In that country a man who could do without sleep</p>
<p>might earn double wages,</p>
<p>one as a herdsman of cattle,</p>
<p>and another as a</p>
<p>shepherd,</p>
<p>for they work much the same by night as they do by day.84</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we reached the harbour we found it land-locked under steep</p>
<p>cliffs,</p>
<p>with a narrow entrance between two headlands. My captains took</p>
<p>all their ships inside,</p>
<p>and made them fast close to one another,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>there was never so much as a breath of wind inside,</p>
<p>but it was always</p>
<p>dead calm. I kept my own ship outside,</p>
<p>and moored it to a rock at the</p>
<p>very end of the point; then I climbed a high rock to reconnoitre,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>could see no sign neither of man nor cattle,</p>
<p>only some smoke rising</p>
<p>from the ground. So I sent two of my company with an attendant to find</p>
<p>out what sort of people the inhabitants were.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe men when they got on shore followed a level road by which the</p>
<p>people draw their firewood from the mountains into the town,</p>
<p>till</p>
<p>presently they met a young woman who had come outside to fetch water,</p>
<p>and who was daughter to a Laestrygonian named Antiphates. She was going</p>
<p>to the fountain Artacia from which the people bring in their water,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>when my men had come close up to her,</p>
<p>they asked her who the king of</p>
<p>that country might be,</p>
<p>and over what kind of people he ruled; so she</p>
<p>directed them to her father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>but when they got there they found</p>
<p>his wife to be a giantess as huge as a mountain,</p>
<p>and they were</p>
<p>horrified at the sight of her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe at once called her husband Antiphates from the place of assembly,</p>
<p>and forthwith he set about killing my men. He snatched up one of them,</p>
<p>and began to make his dinner off him then and there,</p>
<p>whereon the other</p>
<p>two ran back to the ships as fast as ever they could. But Antiphates</p>
<p>raised a hue-and-cry after them,</p>
<p>and thousands of sturdy Laestrygonians</p>
<p>sprang up from every quarter‚Äîogres,</p>
<p>not men. They threw vast rocks at</p>
<p>us from the cliffs as though they had been mere stones,</p>
<p>and I heard the</p>
<p>horrid sound of the ships crunching up against one another,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>death cries of my men,</p>
<p>as the Laestrygonians speared them like fishes</p>
<p>and took them home to eat them. While they were thus killing my men</p>
<p>within the harbour I drew my sword,</p>
<p>cut the cable of my own ship,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>told my men to row with all their might if they too would not fare like</p>
<p>the rest; so they laid out for their lives,</p>
<p>and we were thankful enough</p>
<p>when we got into open water out of reach of the rocks they hurled at</p>
<p>us. As for the others there was not one of them left.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThence we sailed sadly on,</p>
<p>glad to have escaped death,</p>
<p>though we had</p>
<p>lost our comrades,</p>
<p>and came to the Aeaean island,</p>
<p>where Circe lives‚Äîa</p>
<p>great and cunning goddess who is own sister to the magician Aeetes‚Äîfor</p>
<p>they are both children of the sun by Perse,</p>
<p>who is daughter to Oceanus.</p>
<p>We brought our ship into a safe harbour without a word,</p>
<p>for some god</p>
<p>guided us thither,</p>
<p>and having landed we lay there for two days and two</p>
<p>nights,</p>
<p>worn out in body and mind. When the morning of the third day</p>
<p>came I took my spear and my sword,</p>
<p>and went away from the ship to</p>
<p>reconnoitre,</p>
<p>and see if I could discover signs of human handiwork,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>hear the sound of voices. Climbing to the top of a high look-out I</p>
<p>espied the smoke of Circe‚Äôs house rising upwards amid a dense forest of</p>
<p>trees,</p>
<p>and when I saw this I doubted whether,</p>
<p>having seen the smoke,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>would not go on at once and find out more,</p>
<p>but in the end I deemed it</p>
<p>best to go back to the ship,</p>
<p>give the men their dinners,</p>
<p>and send some</p>
<p>of them instead of going myself.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I had nearly got back to the ship some god took pity upon my</p>
<p>solitude,</p>
<p>and sent a fine antlered stag right into the middle of my</p>
<p>path. He was coming down his pasture in the forest to drink of the</p>
<p>river,</p>
<p>for the heat of the sun drove him,</p>
<p>and as he passed I struck him</p>
<p>in the middle of the back; the bronze point of the spear went clean</p>
<p>through him,</p>
<p>and he lay groaning in the dust until the life went out of</p>
<p>him. Then I set my foot upon him,</p>
<p>drew my spear from the wound,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>laid it down; I also gathered rough grass and rushes and twisted them</p>
<p>into a fathom or so of good stout rope,</p>
<p>with which I bound the four</p>
<p>feet of the noble creature together; having so done I hung him round my</p>
<p>neck and walked back to the ship leaning upon my spear,</p>
<p>for the stag</p>
<p>was much too big for me to be able to carry him on my shoulder,</p>
<p>steadying him with one hand. As I threw him down in front of the ship,</p>
<p>I called the men and spoke cheeringly man by man to each of them. ‚ÄòLook</p>
<p>here my friends,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòwe are not going to die so much before our</p>
<p>time after all,</p>
<p>and at any rate we will not starve so long as we have</p>
<p>got something to eat and drink on board.‚Äô On this they uncovered their</p>
<p>heads upon the sea shore and admired the stag,</p>
<p>for he was indeed a</p>
<p>splendid fellow. Then,</p>
<p>when they had feasted their eyes upon him</p>
<p>sufficiently,</p>
<p>they washed their hands and began to cook him for dinner.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus through the livelong day to the going down of the sun we stayed</p>
<p>there eating and drinking our fill,</p>
<p>but when the sun went down and it</p>
<p>came on dark,</p>
<p>we camped upon the sea shore. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>I called a council and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy friends,</p>
<p>we are in very great difficulties; listen therefore to me. We have no</p>
<p>idea where the sun either sets or rises,</p>
<p>85 so that we do not even know</p>
<p>East from West. I see no way out of it; nevertheless,</p>
<p>we must try and</p>
<p>find one. We are certainly on an island,</p>
<p>for I went as high as I could</p>
<p>this morning,</p>
<p>and saw the sea reaching all round it to the horizon; it</p>
<p>lies low,</p>
<p>but towards the middle I saw smoke rising from out of a thick</p>
<p>forest of trees.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúTheir hearts sank as they heard me,</p>
<p>for they remembered how they had</p>
<p>been treated by the Laestrygonian Antiphates,</p>
<p>and by the savage ogre</p>
<p>Polyphemus. They wept bitterly in their dismay,</p>
<p>but there was nothing</p>
<p>to be got by crying,</p>
<p>so I divided them into two companies and set a</p>
<p>captain over each; I gave one company to Eurylochus,</p>
<p>while I took</p>
<p>command of the other myself. Then we cast lots in a helmet,</p>
<p>and the lot</p>
<p>fell upon Eurylochus; so he set out with his twenty-two men,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>wept,</p>
<p>as also did we who were left behind.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen they reached Circe‚Äôs house they found it built of cut stones,</p>
<p>on</p>
<p>a site that could be seen from far,</p>
<p>in the middle of the forest. There</p>
<p>were wild mountain wolves and lions prowling all round it‚Äîpoor</p>
<p>bewitched creatures whom she had tamed by her enchantments and drugged</p>
<p>into subjection. They did not attack my men,</p>
<p>but wagged their great</p>
<p>tails,</p>
<p>fawned upon them,</p>
<p>and rubbed their noses lovingly against</p>
<p>them.86 As hounds crowd round their master when they see him coming</p>
<p>from dinner‚Äîfor they know he will bring them something‚Äîeven so did</p>
<p>these wolves and lions with their great claws fawn upon my men,</p>
<p>but the</p>
<p>men were terribly frightened at seeing such strange creatures.</p>
<p>Presently they reached the gates of the goddess‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>and as they</p>
<p>stood there they could hear Circe within,</p>
<p>singing most beautifully as</p>
<p>she worked at her loom,</p>
<p>making a web so fine,</p>
<p>so soft,</p>
<p>and of such</p>
<p>dazzling colours as no one but a goddess could weave. On this Polites,</p>
<p>whom I valued and trusted more than any other of my men,</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòThere</p>
<p>is some one inside working at a loom and singing most beautifully; the</p>
<p>whole place resounds with it,</p>
<p>let us call her and see whether she is</p>
<p>woman or goddess.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey called her and she came down,</p>
<p>unfastened the door,</p>
<p>and bade them</p>
<p>enter. They,</p>
<p>thinking no evil,</p>
<p>followed her,</p>
<p>all except Eurylochus,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>suspected mischief and staid outside. When she had got them into her</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>she set them upon benches and seats and mixed them a mess with</p>
<p>cheese,</p>
<p>honey,</p>
<p>meal,</p>
<p>and Pramnian wine,</p>
<p>but she drugged it with wicked</p>
<p>poisons to make them forget their homes,</p>
<p>and when they had drunk she</p>
<p>turned them into pigs by a stroke of her wand,</p>
<p>and shut them up in her</p>
<p>pig-styes. They were like pigs‚Äîhead,</p>
<p>hair,</p>
<p>and all,</p>
<p>and they grunted</p>
<p>just as pigs do; but their senses were the same as before,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>remembered everything.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus then were they shut up squealing,</p>
<p>and Circe threw them some</p>
<p>acorns and beech masts such as pigs eat,</p>
<p>but Eurylochus hurried back to</p>
<p>tell me about the sad fate of our comrades. He was so overcome with</p>
<p>dismay that though he tried to speak he could find no words to do so;</p>
<p>his eyes filled with tears and he could only sob and sigh,</p>
<p>till at last</p>
<p>we forced his story out of him,</p>
<p>and he told us what had happened to the</p>
<p>others.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWe went,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚Äòas you told us,</p>
<p>through the forest,</p>
<p>and in the</p>
<p>middle of it there was a fine house built with cut stones in a place</p>
<p>that could be seen from far. There we found a woman,</p>
<p>or else she was a</p>
<p>goddess,</p>
<p>working at her loom and singing sweetly; so the men shouted to</p>
<p>her and called her,</p>
<p>whereon she at once came down,</p>
<p>opened the door,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>invited us in. The others did not suspect any mischief so they followed</p>
<p>her into the house,</p>
<p>but I staid where I was,</p>
<p>for I thought there might</p>
<p>be some treachery. From that moment I saw them no more,</p>
<p>for not one of</p>
<p>them ever came out,</p>
<p>though I sat a long time watching for them.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I took my sword of bronze and slung it over my shoulders; I also</p>
<p>took my bow,</p>
<p>and told Eurylochus to come back with me and shew me the</p>
<p>way. But he laid hold of me with both his hands and spoke piteously,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSir,</p>
<p>do not force me to go with you,</p>
<p>but let me stay here,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>I know you will not bring one of them back with you,</p>
<p>nor even return</p>
<p>alive yourself; let us rather see if we cannot escape at any rate with</p>
<p>the few that are left us,</p>
<p>for we may still save our lives.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòStay where you are,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>‚Äô answered I,</p>
<p>‚Äòeating and drinking at the</p>
<p>ship,</p>
<p>but I must go,</p>
<p>for I am most urgently bound to do so.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWith this I left the ship and went up inland. When I got through the</p>
<p>charmed grove,</p>
<p>and was near the great house of the enchantress Circe,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>met Mercury with his golden wand,</p>
<p>disguised as a young man in the</p>
<p>hey-day of his youth and beauty with the down just coming upon his</p>
<p>face. He came up to me and took my hand within his own,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy</p>
<p>poor unhappy man,</p>
<p>whither are you going over this mountain top,</p>
<p>alone</p>
<p>and without knowing the way? Your men are shut up in Circe‚Äôs pigstyes,</p>
<p>like so many wild boars in their lairs. You surely do not fancy that</p>
<p>you can set them free? I can tell you that you will never get back and</p>
<p>will have to stay there with the rest of them. But never mind,</p>
<p>I will</p>
<p>protect you and get you out of your difficulty. Take this herb,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>is one of great virtue,</p>
<p>and keep it about you when you go to Circe‚Äôs</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>it will be a talisman to you against every kind of mischief.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòAnd I will tell you of all the wicked witchcraft that Circe will try</p>
<p>to practice upon you. She will mix a mess for you to drink,</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>will drug the meal with which she makes it,</p>
<p>but she will not be able to</p>
<p>charm you,</p>
<p>for the virtue of the herb that I shall give you will</p>
<p>prevent her spells from working. I will tell you all about it. When</p>
<p>Circe strikes you with her wand,</p>
<p>draw your sword and spring upon her as</p>
<p>though you were going to kill her. She will then be frightened,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>will desire you to go to bed with her; on this you must not point blank</p>
<p>refuse her,</p>
<p>for you want her to set your companions free,</p>
<p>and to take</p>
<p>good care also of yourself,</p>
<p>but you must make her swear solemnly by all</p>
<p>the blessed gods that she will plot no further mischief against you,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>else when she has got you naked she will unman you and make you fit for</p>
<p>nothing.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs he spoke he pulled the herb out of the ground and shewed me what it</p>
<p>was like. The root was black,</p>
<p>while the flower was as white as milk;</p>
<p>the gods call it Moly,</p>
<p>and mortal men cannot uproot it,</p>
<p>but the gods</p>
<p>can do whatever they like.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen Mercury went back to high Olympus passing over the wooded island;</p>
<p>but I fared onward to the house of Circe,</p>
<p>and my heart was clouded with</p>
<p>care as I walked along. When I got to the gates I stood there and</p>
<p>called the goddess,</p>
<p>and as soon as she heard me she came down,</p>
<p>opened</p>
<p>the door,</p>
<p>and asked me to come in; so I followed her‚Äîmuch troubled in</p>
<p>my mind. She set me on a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver,</p>
<p>there was a footstool also under my feet,</p>
<p>and she mixed a mess in a</p>
<p>golden goblet for me to drink; but she drugged it,</p>
<p>for she meant me</p>
<p>mischief. When she had given it me,</p>
<p>and I had drunk it without its</p>
<p>charming me,</p>
<p>she struck me with her wand. ‚ÄòThere now,</p>
<p>‚Äô she cried,</p>
<p>‚Äòbe</p>
<p>off to the pigstye,</p>
<p>and make your lair with the rest of them.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut I rushed at her with my sword drawn as though I would kill her,</p>
<p>whereon she fell with a loud scream,</p>
<p>clasped my knees,</p>
<p>and spoke</p>
<p>piteously,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWho and whence are you? from what place and people</p>
<p>have you come? How can it be that my drugs have no power to charm you?</p>
<p>Never yet was any man able to stand so much as a taste of the herb I</p>
<p>gave you; you must be spell-proof; surely you can be none other than</p>
<p>the bold hero Ulysses,</p>
<p>who Mercury always said would come here some day</p>
<p>with his ship while on his way home from Troy; so be it then; sheathe</p>
<p>your sword and let us go to bed,</p>
<p>that we may make friends and learn to</p>
<p>trust each other.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄòCirce,</p>
<p>how can you expect me to be friendly with you</p>
<p>when you have just been turning all my men into pigs? And now that you</p>
<p>have got me here myself,</p>
<p>you mean me mischief when you ask me to go to</p>
<p>bed with you,</p>
<p>and will unman me and make me fit for nothing. I shall</p>
<p>certainly not consent to go to bed with you unless you will first take</p>
<p>your solemn oath to plot no further harm against me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo she swore at once as I had told her,</p>
<p>and when she had completed her</p>
<p>oath then I went to bed with her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile her four servants,</p>
<p>who are her housemaids,</p>
<p>set about their</p>
<p>work. They are the children of the groves and fountains,</p>
<p>and of the</p>
<p>holy waters that run down into the sea. One of them spread a fair</p>
<p>purple cloth over a seat,</p>
<p>and laid a carpet underneath it. Another</p>
<p>brought tables of silver up to the seats,</p>
<p>and set them with baskets of</p>
<p>gold. A third mixed some sweet wine with water in a silver bowl and put</p>
<p>golden cups upon the tables,</p>
<p>while the fourth brought in water and set</p>
<p>it to boil in a large cauldron over a good fire which she had lighted.</p>
<p>When the water in the cauldron was boiling,</p>
<p>87 she poured cold into it</p>
<p>till it was just as I liked it,</p>
<p>and then she set me in a bath and began</p>
<p>washing me from the cauldron about the head and shoulders,</p>
<p>to take the</p>
<p>tire and stiffness out of my limbs. As soon as she had done washing me</p>
<p>and anointing me with oil,</p>
<p>she arrayed me in a good cloak and shirt and</p>
<p>led me to a richly decorated seat inlaid with silver; there was a</p>
<p>footstool also under my feet. A maid servant then brought me water in a</p>
<p>beautiful golden ewer and poured it into a silver basin for me to wash</p>
<p>my hands,</p>
<p>and she drew a clean table beside me; an upper servant</p>
<p>brought me bread and offered me many things of what there was in the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and then Circe bade me eat,</p>
<p>but I would not,</p>
<p>and sat without</p>
<p>heeding what was before me,</p>
<p>still moody and suspicious.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen Circe saw me sitting there without eating,</p>
<p>and in great grief,</p>
<p>she came to me and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>why do you sit like that as though</p>
<p>you were dumb,</p>
<p>gnawing at your own heart,</p>
<p>and refusing both meat and</p>
<p>drink? Is it that you are still suspicious? You ought not to be,</p>
<p>for I</p>
<p>have already sworn solemnly that I will not hurt you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòCirce,</p>
<p>no man with any sense of what is right can think</p>
<p>of either eating or drinking in your house until you have set his</p>
<p>friends free and let him see them. If you want me to eat and drink,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>must free my men and bring them to me that I may see them with my own</p>
<p>eyes.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I had said this she went straight through the court with her wand</p>
<p>in her hand and opened the pigstye doors. My men came out like so many</p>
<p>prime hogs and stood looking at her,</p>
<p>but she went about among them and</p>
<p>anointed each with a second drug,</p>
<p>whereon the bristles that the bad</p>
<p>drug had given them fell off,</p>
<p>and they became men again,</p>
<p>younger than</p>
<p>they were before,</p>
<p>and much taller and better looking. They knew me at</p>
<p>once,</p>
<p>seized me each of them by the hand,</p>
<p>and wept for joy till the</p>
<p>whole house was filled with the sound of their halloa-ballooing,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Circe herself was so sorry for them that she came up to me and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>go back at once to the sea where you</p>
<p>have left your ship,</p>
<p>and first draw it on to the land. Then,</p>
<p>hide all</p>
<p>your ship‚Äôs gear and property in some cave,</p>
<p>and come back here with</p>
<p>your men.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI agreed to this,</p>
<p>so I went back to the sea shore,</p>
<p>and found the men</p>
<p>at the ship weeping and wailing most piteously. When they saw me the</p>
<p>silly blubbering fellows began frisking round me as calves break out</p>
<p>and gambol round their mothers,</p>
<p>when they see them coming home to be</p>
<p>milked after they have been feeding all day,</p>
<p>and the homestead resounds</p>
<p>with their lowing. They seemed as glad to see me as though they had got</p>
<p>back to their own rugged Ithaca,</p>
<p>where they had been born and bred.</p>
<p>‚ÄòSir,</p>
<p>‚Äô said the affectionate creatures,</p>
<p>‚Äòwe are as glad to see you back</p>
<p>as though we had got safe home to Ithaca; but tell us all about the</p>
<p>fate of our comrades.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI spoke comfortingly to them and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWe must draw our ship on to</p>
<p>the land,</p>
<p>and hide the ship‚Äôs gear with all our property in some cave;</p>
<p>then come with me all of you as fast as you can to Circe‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>you will find your comrades eating and drinking in the midst of great</p>
<p>abundance.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this the men would have come with me at once,</p>
<p>but Eurylochus tried</p>
<p>to hold them back and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAlas,</p>
<p>poor wretches that we are,</p>
<p>what will</p>
<p>become of us? Rush not on your ruin by going to the house of Circe,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>will turn us all into pigs or wolves or lions,</p>
<p>and we shall have to</p>
<p>keep guard over her house. Remember how the Cyclops treated us when our</p>
<p>comrades went inside his cave,</p>
<p>and Ulysses with them. It was all</p>
<p>through his sheer folly that those men lost their lives.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I heard him I was in two minds whether or no to draw the keen</p>
<p>blade that hung by my sturdy thigh and cut his head off in spite of his</p>
<p>being a near relation of my own; but the men interceded for him and</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSir,</p>
<p>if it may so be,</p>
<p>let this fellow stay here and mind the</p>
<p>ship,</p>
<p>but take the rest of us with you to Circe‚Äôs house.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this we all went inland,</p>
<p>and Eurylochus was not left behind after</p>
<p>all,</p>
<p>but came on too,</p>
<p>for he was frightened by the severe reprimand</p>
<p>that I had given him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile Circe had been seeing that the men who had been left behind</p>
<p>were washed and anointed with olive oil; she had also given them</p>
<p>woollen cloaks and shirts,</p>
<p>and when we came we found them all</p>
<p>comfortably at dinner in her house. As soon as the men saw each other</p>
<p>face to face and knew one another,</p>
<p>they wept for joy and cried aloud</p>
<p>till the whole palace rang again. Thereon Circe came up to me and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>tell your men to leave off crying; I</p>
<p>know how much you have all of you suffered at sea,</p>
<p>and how ill you have</p>
<p>fared among cruel savages on the mainland,</p>
<p>but that is over now,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>stay here,</p>
<p>and eat and drink till you are once more as strong and</p>
<p>hearty as you were when you left Ithaca; for at present you are</p>
<p>weakened both in body and mind; you keep all the time thinking of the</p>
<p>hardships you have suffered during your travels,</p>
<p>so that you have no</p>
<p>more cheerfulness left in you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus did she speak and we assented. We stayed with Circe for a whole</p>
<p>twelvemonth feasting upon an untold quantity both of meat and wine. But</p>
<p>when the year had passed in the waning of moons and the long days had</p>
<p>come round,</p>
<p>my men called me apart and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSir,</p>
<p>it is time you began</p>
<p>to think about going home,</p>
<p>if so be you are to be spared to see your</p>
<p>house and native country at all.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus did they speak and I assented. Thereon through the livelong day</p>
<p>to the going down of the sun we feasted our fill on meat and wine,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>when the sun went down and it came on dark the men laid themselves down</p>
<p>to sleep in the covered cloisters. I,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>after I had got into bed</p>
<p>with Circe,</p>
<p>besought her by her knees,</p>
<p>and the goddess listened to what</p>
<p>I had got to say. ‚ÄòCirce,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòplease to keep the promise you made</p>
<p>me about furthering me on my homeward voyage. I want to get back and so</p>
<p>do my men,</p>
<p>they are always pestering me with their complaints as soon</p>
<p>as ever your back is turned.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd the goddess answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>you shall</p>
<p>none of you stay here any longer if you do not want to,</p>
<p>but there is</p>
<p>another journey which you have got to take before you can sail</p>
<p>homewards. You must go to the house of Hades and of dread Proserpine to</p>
<p>consult the ghost of the blind Theban prophet Teiresias,</p>
<p>whose reason</p>
<p>is still unshaken. To him alone has Proserpine left his understanding</p>
<p>even in death,</p>
<p>but the other ghosts flit about aimlessly.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was dismayed when I heard this. I sat up in bed and wept,</p>
<p>and would</p>
<p>gladly have lived no longer to see the light of the sun,</p>
<p>but presently</p>
<p>when I was tired of weeping and tossing myself about,</p>
<p>I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAnd who</p>
<p>shall guide me upon this voyage‚Äîfor the house of Hades is a port that</p>
<p>no ship can reach.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou will want no guide,</p>
<p>‚Äô she answered; ‚Äòraise your mast,</p>
<p>set your</p>
<p>white sails,</p>
<p>sit quite still,</p>
<p>and the North Wind will blow you there of</p>
<p>itself. When your ship has traversed the waters of Oceanus,</p>
<p>you will</p>
<p>reach the fertile shore of Proserpine‚Äôs country with its groves of tall</p>
<p>poplars and willows that shed their fruit untimely; here beach your</p>
<p>ship upon the shore of Oceanus,</p>
<p>and go straight on to the dark abode of</p>
<p>Hades. You will find it near the place where the rivers Pyriphlegethon</p>
<p>and Cocytus (which is a branch of the river Styx) flow into Acheron,</p>
<p>and you will see a rock near it,</p>
<p>just where the two roaring rivers run</p>
<p>into one another.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWhen you have reached this spot,</p>
<p>as I now tell you,</p>
<p>dig a trench a</p>
<p>cubit or so in length,</p>
<p>breadth,</p>
<p>and depth,</p>
<p>and pour into it as a</p>
<p>drink-offering to all the dead,</p>
<p>first,</p>
<p>honey mixed with milk,</p>
<p>then</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>and in the third place water‚Äîsprinkling white barley meal over</p>
<p>the whole. Moreover you must offer many prayers to the poor feeble</p>
<p>ghosts,</p>
<p>and promise them that when you get back to Ithaca you will</p>
<p>sacrifice a barren heifer to them,</p>
<p>the best you have,</p>
<p>and will load the</p>
<p>pyre with good things. More particularly you must promise that</p>
<p>Teiresias shall have a black sheep all to himself,</p>
<p>the finest in all</p>
<p>your flocks.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWhen you shall have thus besought the ghosts with your prayers,</p>
<p>offer</p>
<p>them a ram and a black ewe,</p>
<p>bending their heads towards Erebus; but</p>
<p>yourself turn away from them as though you would make towards the</p>
<p>river. On this,</p>
<p>many dead men‚Äôs ghosts will come to you,</p>
<p>and you must</p>
<p>tell your men to skin the two sheep that you have just killed,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>offer them as a burnt sacrifice with prayers to Hades and to</p>
<p>Proserpine. Then draw your sword and sit there,</p>
<p>so as to prevent any</p>
<p>other poor ghost from coming near the spilt blood before Teiresias</p>
<p>shall have answered your questions. The seer will presently come to</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>and will tell you about your voyage‚Äîwhat stages you are to make,</p>
<p>and how you are to sail the sea so as to reach your home.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt was day-break by the time she had done speaking,</p>
<p>so she dressed me</p>
<p>in my shirt and cloak. As for herself she threw a beautiful light</p>
<p>gossamer fabric over her shoulders,</p>
<p>fastening it with a golden girdle</p>
<p>round her waist,</p>
<p>and she covered her head with a mantle. Then I went</p>
<p>about among the men everywhere all over the house,</p>
<p>and spoke kindly to</p>
<p>each of them man by man: ‚ÄòYou must not lie sleeping here any longer,</p>
<p>‚Äô</p>
<p>said I to them,</p>
<p>‚Äòwe must be going,</p>
<p>for Circe has told me all about it.‚Äô</p>
<p>And on this they did as I bade them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúEven so,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I did not get them away without misadventure. We had</p>
<p>with us a certain youth named Elpenor,</p>
<p>not very remarkable for sense or</p>
<p>courage,</p>
<p>who had got drunk and was lying on the house-top away from the</p>
<p>rest of the men,</p>
<p>to sleep off his liquor in the cool. When he heard the</p>
<p>noise of the men bustling about,</p>
<p>he jumped up on a sudden and forgot</p>
<p>all about coming down by the main staircase,</p>
<p>so he tumbled right off</p>
<p>the roof and broke his neck,</p>
<p>and his soul went down to the house of</p>
<p>Hades.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I had got the men together I said to them,</p>
<p>‚ÄòYou think you are</p>
<p>about to start home again,</p>
<p>but Circe has explained to me that instead</p>
<p>of this,</p>
<p>we have got to go to the house of Hades and Proserpine to</p>
<p>consult the ghost of the Theban prophet Teiresias.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe men were broken-hearted as they heard me,</p>
<p>and threw themselves on</p>
<p>the ground groaning and tearing their hair,</p>
<p>but they did not mend</p>
<p>matters by crying. When we reached the sea shore,</p>
<p>weeping and lamenting</p>
<p>our fate,</p>
<p>Circe brought the ram and the ewe,</p>
<p>and we made them fast hard</p>
<p>by the ship. She passed through the midst of us without our knowing it,</p>
<p>for who can see the comings and goings of a god,</p>
<p>if the god does not</p>
<p>wish to be seen?</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XI</span>
<p>THE VISIT TO THE DEAD.88</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,</p>
<p>when we had got down to the sea shore we drew our ship into the</p>
<p>water and got her mast and sails into her; we also put the sheep on</p>
<p>board and took our places,</p>
<p>weeping and in great distress of mind.</p>
<p>Circe,</p>
<p>that great and cunning goddess,</p>
<p>sent us a fair wind that blew</p>
<p>dead aft and staid steadily with us keeping our sails all the time well</p>
<p>filled; so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship‚Äôs gear and let her</p>
<p>go as the wind and helmsman headed her. All day long her sails were</p>
<p>full as she held her course over the sea,</p>
<p>but when the sun went down</p>
<p>and darkness was over all the earth,</p>
<p>we got into the deep waters of the</p>
<p>river Oceanus,</p>
<p>where lie the land and city of the Cimmerians who live</p>
<p>enshrouded in mist and darkness which the rays of the sun never pierce</p>
<p>neither at his rising nor as he goes down again out of the heavens,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the poor wretches live in one long melancholy night. When we got there</p>
<p>we beached the ship,</p>
<p>took the sheep out of her,</p>
<p>and went along by the</p>
<p>waters of Oceanus till we came to the place of which Circe had told us.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere Perimedes and Eurylochus held the victims,</p>
<p>while I drew my sword</p>
<p>and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the</p>
<p>dead,</p>
<p>first with honey and milk,</p>
<p>then with wine,</p>
<p>and thirdly with</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole,</p>
<p>praying</p>
<p>earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts,</p>
<p>and promising them that when I</p>
<p>got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them,</p>
<p>the best</p>
<p>I had,</p>
<p>and would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly</p>
<p>promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself,</p>
<p>the best</p>
<p>in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead,</p>
<p>I cut the</p>
<p>throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench,</p>
<p>whereon</p>
<p>the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus‚Äîbrides,</p>
<p>89 young bachelors,</p>
<p>old</p>
<p>men worn out with toil,</p>
<p>maids who had been crossed in love,</p>
<p>and brave</p>
<p>men who had been killed in battle,</p>
<p>with their armour still smirched</p>
<p>with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench</p>
<p>with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with</p>
<p>fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the</p>
<p>carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I</p>
<p>sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless</p>
<p>ghosts come near the blood till Teiresias should have answered my</p>
<p>questions.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first ghost that came was that of my comrade Elpenor,</p>
<p>for he had</p>
<p>not yet been laid beneath the earth. We had left his body unwaked and</p>
<p>unburied in Circe‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>for we had had too much else to do. I was</p>
<p>very sorry for him,</p>
<p>and cried when I saw him: ‚ÄòElpenor,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòhow</p>
<p>did you come down here into this gloom and darkness? You have got here</p>
<p>on foot quicker than I have with my ship.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòSir,</p>
<p>‚Äô he answered with a groan,</p>
<p>‚Äòit was all bad luck,</p>
<p>and my own</p>
<p>unspeakable drunkenness. I was lying asleep on the top of Circe‚Äôs</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and never thought of coming down again by the great staircase</p>
<p>but fell right off the roof and broke my neck,</p>
<p>so my soul came down to</p>
<p>the house of Hades. And now I beseech you by all those whom you have</p>
<p>left behind you,</p>
<p>though they are not here,</p>
<p>by your wife,</p>
<p>by the father</p>
<p>who brought you up when you were a child,</p>
<p>and by Telemachus who is the</p>
<p>one hope of your house,</p>
<p>do what I shall now ask you. I know that when</p>
<p>you leave this limbo you will again hold your ship for the Aeaean</p>
<p>island. Do not go thence leaving me unwaked and unburied behind you,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>I may bring heaven‚Äôs anger upon you; but burn me with whatever armour I</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>build a barrow for me on the sea shore,</p>
<p>that may tell people in</p>
<p>days to come what a poor unlucky fellow I was,</p>
<p>and plant over my grave</p>
<p>the oar I used to row with when I was yet alive and with my messmates.‚Äô</p>
<p>And I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy poor fellow,</p>
<p>I will do all that you have asked of me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>did we sit and hold sad talk with one another,</p>
<p>I on the</p>
<p>one side of the trench with my sword held over the blood,</p>
<p>and the ghost</p>
<p>of my comrade saying all this to me from the other side. Then came the</p>
<p>ghost of my dead mother Anticlea,</p>
<p>daughter to Autolycus. I had left her</p>
<p>alive when I set out for Troy and was moved to tears when I saw her,</p>
<p>but even so,</p>
<p>for all my sorrow I would not let her come near the blood</p>
<p>till I had asked my questions of Teiresias.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen came also the ghost of Theban Teiresias,</p>
<p>with his golden sceptre</p>
<p>in his hand. He knew me and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>why,</p>
<p>poor man,</p>
<p>have you left the light of day and come down to visit the</p>
<p>dead in this sad place? Stand back from the trench and withdraw your</p>
<p>sword that I may drink of the blood and answer your questions truly.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo I drew back,</p>
<p>and sheathed my sword,</p>
<p>whereon when he had drank of</p>
<p>the blood he began with his prophecy.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou want to know,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚Äòabout your return home,</p>
<p>but heaven will</p>
<p>make this hard for you. I do not think that you will escape the eye of</p>
<p>Neptune,</p>
<p>who still nurses his bitter grudge against you for having</p>
<p>blinded his son. Still,</p>
<p>after much suffering you may get home if you</p>
<p>can restrain yourself and your companions when your ship reaches the</p>
<p>Thrinacian island,</p>
<p>where you will find the sheep and cattle belonging</p>
<p>to the sun,</p>
<p>who sees and gives ear to everything. If you leave these</p>
<p>flocks unharmed and think of nothing but of getting home,</p>
<p>you may yet</p>
<p>after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you harm them,</p>
<p>then I forewarn</p>
<p>you of the destruction both of your ship and of your men. Even though</p>
<p>you may yourself escape,</p>
<p>you will return in bad plight after losing all</p>
<p>your men,</p>
<p>[in another man‚Äôs ship,</p>
<p>and you will find trouble in your</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>which will be overrun by high-handed people,</p>
<p>who are devouring</p>
<p>your substance under the pretext of paying court and making presents to</p>
<p>your wife.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWhen you get home you will take your revenge on these suitors; and</p>
<p>after you have killed them by force or fraud in your own house,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>must take a well made oar and carry it on and on,</p>
<p>till you come to a</p>
<p>country where the people have never heard of the sea and do not even</p>
<p>mix salt with their food,</p>
<p>nor do they know anything about ships,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>oars that are as the wings of a ship. I will give you this certain</p>
<p>token which cannot escape your notice. A wayfarer will meet you and</p>
<p>will say it must be a winnowing shovel that you have got upon your</p>
<p>shoulder; on this you must fix the oar in the ground and sacrifice a</p>
<p>ram,</p>
<p>a bull,</p>
<p>and a boar to Neptune.90 Then go home and offer hecatombs</p>
<p>to all the gods in heaven one after the other. As for yourself,</p>
<p>death</p>
<p>shall come to you from the sea,</p>
<p>and your life shall ebb away very</p>
<p>gently when you are full of years and peace of mind,</p>
<p>and your people</p>
<p>shall bless you. All that I have said will come true].‚Äô91</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòThis,</p>
<p>‚Äô I answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòmust be as it may please heaven,</p>
<p>but tell me and</p>
<p>tell me and tell me true,</p>
<p>I see my poor mother‚Äôs ghost close by us; she</p>
<p>is sitting by the blood without saying a word,</p>
<p>and though I am her own</p>
<p>son she does not remember me and speak to me; tell me,</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
<p>how I can</p>
<p>make her know me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòThat,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI can soon do. Any ghost that you let taste of the</p>
<p>blood will talk with you like a reasonable being,</p>
<p>but if you do not let</p>
<p>them have any blood they will go away again.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this the ghost of Teiresias went back to the house of Hades,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>his prophecyings had now been spoken,</p>
<p>but I sat still where I was until</p>
<p>my mother came up and tasted the blood. Then she knew me at once and</p>
<p>spoke fondly to me,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy son,</p>
<p>how did you come down to this</p>
<p>abode of darkness while you are still alive? It is a hard thing for the</p>
<p>living to see these places,</p>
<p>for between us and them there are great and</p>
<p>terrible waters,</p>
<p>and there is Oceanus,</p>
<p>which no man can cross on foot,</p>
<p>but he must have a good ship to take him. Are you all this time trying</p>
<p>to find your way home from Troy,</p>
<p>and have you never yet got back to</p>
<p>Ithaca nor seen your wife in your own house?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMother,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI was forced to come here to consult the ghost of</p>
<p>the Theban prophet Teiresias. I have never yet been near the Achaean</p>
<p>land nor set foot on my native country,</p>
<p>and I have had nothing but one</p>
<p>long series of misfortunes from the very first day that I set out with</p>
<p>Agamemnon for Ilius,</p>
<p>the land of noble steeds,</p>
<p>to fight the Trojans.</p>
<p>But tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>in what way did you die? Did you have a</p>
<p>long illness,</p>
<p>or did heaven vouchsafe you a gentle easy passage to</p>
<p>eternity? Tell me also about my father,</p>
<p>and the son whom I left behind</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>is my property still in their hands,</p>
<p>or has some one else got hold</p>
<p>of it,</p>
<p>who thinks that I shall not return to claim it? Tell me again</p>
<p>what my wife intends doing,</p>
<p>and in what mind she is; does she live with</p>
<p>my son and guard my estate securely,</p>
<p>or has she made the best match she</p>
<p>could and married again?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy mother answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄòYour wife still remains in your house,</p>
<p>but she is</p>
<p>in great distress of mind and spends her whole time in tears both night</p>
<p>and day. No one as yet has got possession of your fine property,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Telemachus still holds your lands undisturbed. He has to entertain</p>
<p>largely,</p>
<p>as of course he must,</p>
<p>considering his position as a</p>
<p>magistrate,</p>
<p>92 and how every one invites him; your father remains at his</p>
<p>old place in the country and never goes near the town. He has no</p>
<p>comfortable bed nor bedding; in the winter he sleeps on the floor in</p>
<p>front of the fire with the men and goes about all in rags,</p>
<p>but in</p>
<p>summer,</p>
<p>when the warm weather comes on again,</p>
<p>he lies out in the</p>
<p>vineyard on a bed of vine leaves thrown any how upon the ground. He</p>
<p>grieves continually about your never having come home,</p>
<p>and suffers more</p>
<p>and more as he grows older. As for my own end it was in this wise:</p>
<p>heaven did not take me swiftly and painlessly in my own house,</p>
<p>nor was</p>
<p>I attacked by any illness such as those that generally wear people out</p>
<p>and kill them,</p>
<p>but my longing to know what you were doing and the force</p>
<p>of my affection for you‚Äîthis it was that was the death of me.‚Äô93</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I tried to find some way of embracing my poor mother‚Äôs ghost.</p>
<p>Thrice I sprang towards her and tried to clasp her in my arms,</p>
<p>but each</p>
<p>time she flitted from my embrace as it were a dream or phantom,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>being touched to the quick I said to her,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMother,</p>
<p>why do you not stay</p>
<p>still when I would embrace you? If we could throw our arms around one</p>
<p>another we might find sad comfort in the sharing of our sorrows even in</p>
<p>the house of Hades; does Proserpine want to lay a still further load of</p>
<p>grief upon me by mocking me with a phantom only?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMy son,</p>
<p>‚Äô she answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòmost ill-fated of all mankind,</p>
<p>it is not</p>
<p>Proserpine that is beguiling you,</p>
<p>but all people are like this when</p>
<p>they are dead. The sinews no longer hold the flesh and bones together;</p>
<p>these perish in the fierceness of consuming fire as soon as life has</p>
<p>left the body,</p>
<p>and the soul flits away as though it were a dream. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>go back to the light of day as soon as you can,</p>
<p>and note all</p>
<p>these things that you may tell them to your wife hereafter.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus did we converse,</p>
<p>and anon Proserpine sent up the ghosts of the</p>
<p>wives and daughters of all the most famous men. They gathered in crowds</p>
<p>about the blood,</p>
<p>and I considered how I might question them severally.</p>
<p>In the end I deemed that it would be best to draw the keen blade that</p>
<p>hung by my sturdy thigh,</p>
<p>and keep them from all drinking the blood at</p>
<p>once. So they came up one after the other,</p>
<p>and each one as I questioned</p>
<p>her told me her race and lineage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe first I saw was Tyro. She was daughter of Salmoneus and wife of</p>
<p>Cretheus the son of Aeolus.94 She fell in love with the river Enipeus</p>
<p>who is much the most beautiful river in the whole world. Once when she</p>
<p>was taking a walk by his side as usual,</p>
<p>Neptune,</p>
<p>disguised as her</p>
<p>lover,</p>
<p>lay with her at the mouth of the river,</p>
<p>and a huge blue wave</p>
<p>arched itself like a mountain over them to hide both woman and god,</p>
<p>whereon he loosed her virgin girdle and laid her in a deep slumber.</p>
<p>When the god had accomplished the deed of love,</p>
<p>he took her hand in his</p>
<p>own and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòTyro,</p>
<p>rejoice in all good will; the embraces of the gods</p>
<p>are not fruitless,</p>
<p>and you will have fine twins about this time twelve</p>
<p>months. Take great care of them. I am Neptune,</p>
<p>so now go home,</p>
<p>but hold</p>
<p>your tongue and do not tell any one.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen he dived under the sea,</p>
<p>and she in due course bore Pelias and</p>
<p>Neleus,</p>
<p>who both of them served Jove with all their might. Pelias was a</p>
<p>great breeder of sheep and lived in Iolcus,</p>
<p>but the other lived in</p>
<p>Pylos. The rest of her children were by Cretheus,</p>
<p>namely,</p>
<p>Aeson,</p>
<p>Pheres,</p>
<p>and Amythaon,</p>
<p>who was a mighty warrior and charioteer.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNext to her I saw Antiope,</p>
<p>daughter to Asopus,</p>
<p>who could boast of</p>
<p>having slept in the arms of even Jove himself,</p>
<p>and who bore him two</p>
<p>sons Amphion and Zethus. These founded Thebes with its seven gates,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>built a wall all round it; for strong though they were they could not</p>
<p>hold Thebes till they had walled it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I saw Alcmena,</p>
<p>the wife of Amphitryon,</p>
<p>who also bore to Jove</p>
<p>indomitable Hercules; and Megara who was daughter to great King Creon,</p>
<p>and married the redoubtable son of Amphitryon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI also saw fair Epicaste mother of king Oedipodes whose awful lot it</p>
<p>was to marry her own son without suspecting it. He married her after</p>
<p>having killed his father,</p>
<p>but the gods proclaimed the whole story to</p>
<p>the world; whereon he remained king of Thebes,</p>
<p>in great grief for the</p>
<p>spite the gods had borne him; but Epicaste went to the house of the</p>
<p>mighty jailor Hades,</p>
<p>having hanged herself for grief,</p>
<p>and the avenging</p>
<p>spirits haunted him as for an outraged mother‚Äîto his ruing bitterly</p>
<p>thereafter.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I saw Chloris,</p>
<p>whom Neleus married for her beauty,</p>
<p>having given</p>
<p>priceless presents for her. She was youngest daughter to Amphion son of</p>
<p>Iasus and king of Minyan Orchomenus,</p>
<p>and was Queen in Pylos. She bore</p>
<p>Nestor,</p>
<p>Chromius,</p>
<p>and Periclymenus,</p>
<p>and she also bore that marvellously</p>
<p>lovely woman Pero,</p>
<p>who was wooed by all the country round; but Neleus</p>
<p>would only give her to him who should raid the cattle of Iphicles from</p>
<p>the grazing grounds of Phylace,</p>
<p>and this was a hard task. The only man</p>
<p>who would undertake to raid them was a certain excellent seer,</p>
<p>95 but</p>
<p>the will of heaven was against him,</p>
<p>for the rangers of the cattle</p>
<p>caught him and put him in prison; nevertheless when a full year had</p>
<p>passed and the same season came round again,</p>
<p>Iphicles set him at</p>
<p>liberty,</p>
<p>after he had expounded all the oracles of heaven. Thus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>was the will of Jove accomplished.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I saw Leda the wife of Tyndarus,</p>
<p>who bore him two famous sons,</p>
<p>Castor breaker of horses,</p>
<p>and Pollux the mighty boxer. Both these</p>
<p>heroes are lying under the earth,</p>
<p>though they are still alive,</p>
<p>for by a</p>
<p>special dispensation of Jove,</p>
<p>they die and come to life again,</p>
<p>each one</p>
<p>of them every other day throughout all time,</p>
<p>and they have the rank of</p>
<p>gods.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter her I saw Iphimedeia wife of Aloeus who boasted the embrace of</p>
<p>Neptune. She bore two sons Otus and Ephialtes,</p>
<p>but both were short</p>
<p>lived. They were the finest children that were ever born in this world,</p>
<p>and the best looking,</p>
<p>Orion only excepted; for at nine years old they</p>
<p>were nine fathoms high,</p>
<p>and measured nine cubits round the chest. They</p>
<p>threatened to make war with the gods in Olympus,</p>
<p>and tried to set Mount</p>
<p>Ossa on the top of Mount Olympus,</p>
<p>and Mount Pelion on the top of Ossa,</p>
<p>that they might scale heaven itself,</p>
<p>and they would have done it too if</p>
<p>they had been grown up,</p>
<p>but Apollo,</p>
<p>son of Leto,</p>
<p>killed both of them,</p>
<p>before they had got so much as a sign of hair upon their cheeks or</p>
<p>chin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I saw Phaedra,</p>
<p>and Procris,</p>
<p>and fair Ariadne daughter of the</p>
<p>magician Minos,</p>
<p>whom Theseus was carrying off from Crete to Athens,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>he did not enjoy her,</p>
<p>for before he could do so Diana killed her in the</p>
<p>island of Dia on account of what Bacchus had said against her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI also saw Maera and Clymene and hateful Eriphyle,</p>
<p>who sold her own</p>
<p>husband for gold. But it would take me all night if I were to name</p>
<p>every single one of the wives and daughters of heroes whom I saw,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it is time for me to go to bed,</p>
<p>either on board ship with my crew,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>here. As for my escort,</p>
<p>heaven and yourselves will see to it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Here he ended,</p>
<p>and the guests sat all of them enthralled and speechless</p>
<p>throughout the covered cloister. Then Arete said to them:‚Äî</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you think of this man,</p>
<p>O Phaeacians? Is he not tall and good</p>
<p>looking,</p>
<p>and is he not clever? True,</p>
<p>he is my own guest,</p>
<p>but all of you</p>
<p>share in the distinction. Do not be in a hurry to send him away,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>niggardly in the presents you make to one who is in such great need,</p>
<p>for heaven has blessed all of you with great abundance.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then spoke the aged hero Echeneus who was one of the oldest men among</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat our august queen has just said to us</p>
<p>is both reasonable and to the purpose,</p>
<p>therefore be persuaded by it;</p>
<p>but the decision whether in word or deed rests ultimately with King</p>
<p>Alcinous.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe thing shall be done,</p>
<p>‚Äù exclaimed Alcinous,</p>
<p>‚Äúas surely as I still</p>
<p>live and reign over the Phaeacians. Our guest is indeed very anxious to</p>
<p>get home,</p>
<p>still we must persuade him to remain with us until to-morrow,</p>
<p>by which time I shall be able to get together the whole sum that I mean</p>
<p>to give him. As regards his escort it will be a matter for you all,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>mine above all others as the chief person among you.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúKing Alcinous,</p>
<p>if you were to bid me to stay</p>
<p>here for a whole twelve months,</p>
<p>and then speed me on my way,</p>
<p>loaded</p>
<p>with your noble gifts,</p>
<p>I should obey you gladly and it would redound</p>
<p>greatly to my advantage,</p>
<p>for I should return fuller-handed to my own</p>
<p>people,</p>
<p>and should thus be more respected and beloved by all who see me</p>
<p>when I get back to Ithaca.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Alcinous,</p>
<p>‚Äúnot one of us who sees you has any idea</p>
<p>that you are a charlatan or a swindler. I know there are many people</p>
<p>going about who tell such plausible stories that it is very hard to see</p>
<p>through them,</p>
<p>but there is a style about your language which assures me</p>
<p>of your good disposition. Moreover you have told the story of your own</p>
<p>misfortunes,</p>
<p>and those of the Argives,</p>
<p>as though you were a practiced</p>
<p>bard; but tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>whether you saw any of the mighty</p>
<p>heroes who went to Troy at the same time with yourself,</p>
<p>and perished</p>
<p>there. The evenings are still at their longest,</p>
<p>and it is not yet bed</p>
<p>time‚Äîgo on,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>with your divine story,</p>
<p>for I could stay here</p>
<p>listening till tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>so long as you will continue to tell</p>
<p>us of your adventures.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlcinous,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúthere is a time for making speeches,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>a time for going to bed; nevertheless,</p>
<p>since you so desire,</p>
<p>I will not</p>
<p>refrain from telling you the still sadder tale of those of my comrades</p>
<p>who did not fall fighting with the Trojans,</p>
<p>but perished on their</p>
<p>return,</p>
<p>through the treachery of a wicked woman.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen Proserpine had dismissed the female ghosts in all directions,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>ghost of Agamemnon son of Atreus came sadly up to me,</p>
<p>surrounded by</p>
<p>those who had perished with him in the house of Aegisthus. As soon as</p>
<p>he had tasted the blood,</p>
<p>he knew me,</p>
<p>and weeping bitterly stretched out</p>
<p>his arms towards me to embrace me; but he had no strength nor substance</p>
<p>any more,</p>
<p>and I too wept and pitied him as I beheld him. ‚ÄòHow did you</p>
<p>come by your death,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚ÄòKing Agamemnon? Did Neptune raise his</p>
<p>winds and waves against you when you were at sea,</p>
<p>or did your enemies</p>
<p>make an end of you on the main land when you were cattle-lifting or</p>
<p>sheep-stealing,</p>
<p>or while they were fighting in defence of their wives</p>
<p>and city?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äô he answered,</p>
<p>‚Äònoble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>I was not lost at sea</p>
<p>in any storm of Neptune‚Äôs raising,</p>
<p>nor did my foes despatch me upon the</p>
<p>mainland,</p>
<p>but Aegisthus and my wicked wife were the death of me between</p>
<p>them. He asked me to his house,</p>
<p>feasted me,</p>
<p>and then butchered me most</p>
<p>miserably as though I were a fat beast in a slaughter house,</p>
<p>while all</p>
<p>around me my comrades were slain like sheep or pigs for the wedding</p>
<p>breakfast,</p>
<p>or picnic,</p>
<p>or gorgeous banquet of some great nobleman. You</p>
<p>must have seen numbers of men killed either in a general engagement,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>in single combat,</p>
<p>but you never saw anything so truly pitiable as the</p>
<p>way in which we fell in that cloister,</p>
<p>with the mixing bowl and the</p>
<p>loaded tables lying all about,</p>
<p>and the ground reeking with our blood. I</p>
<p>heard Priam‚Äôs daughter Cassandra scream as Clytemnestra killed her</p>
<p>close beside me. I lay dying upon the earth with the sword in my body,</p>
<p>and raised my hands to kill the slut of a murderess,</p>
<p>but she slipped</p>
<p>away from me; she would not even close my lips nor my eyes when I was</p>
<p>dying,</p>
<p>for there is nothing in this world so cruel and so shameless as</p>
<p>a woman when she has fallen into such guilt as hers was. Fancy</p>
<p>murdering her own husband! I thought I was going to be welcomed home by</p>
<p>my children and my servants,</p>
<p>but her abominable crime has brought</p>
<p>disgrace on herself and all women who shall come after‚Äîeven on the good</p>
<p>ones.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòIn truth Jove has hated the house of Atreus from first to</p>
<p>last in the matter of their women‚Äôs counsels. See how many of us fell</p>
<p>for Helen‚Äôs sake,</p>
<p>and now it seems that Clytemnestra hatched mischief</p>
<p>against you too during your absence.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòBe sure,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>‚Äô continued Agamemnon,</p>
<p>‚Äòand not be too friendly</p>
<p>even with your own wife. Do not tell her all that you know perfectly</p>
<p>well yourself. Tell her a part only,</p>
<p>and keep your own counsel about</p>
<p>the rest. Not that your wife,</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>is likely to murder you,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Penelope is a very admirable woman,</p>
<p>and has an excellent nature. We</p>
<p>left her a young bride with an infant at her breast when we set out for</p>
<p>Troy. This child no doubt is now grown up happily to man‚Äôs estate,</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>and he and his father will have a joyful meeting and embrace one</p>
<p>another as it is right they should do,</p>
<p>whereas my wicked wife did not</p>
<p>even allow me the happiness of looking upon my son,</p>
<p>but killed me ere I</p>
<p>could do so. Furthermore I say‚Äîand lay my saying to your heart‚Äîdo not</p>
<p>tell people when you are bringing your ship to Ithaca,</p>
<p>but steal a</p>
<p>march upon them,</p>
<p>for after all this there is no trusting women. But now</p>
<p>tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>can you give me any news of my son Orestes?</p>
<p>Is he in Orchomenus,</p>
<p>or at Pylos,</p>
<p>or is he at Sparta with Menelaus‚Äîfor</p>
<p>I presume that he is still living.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAgamemnon,</p>
<p>why do you ask me? I do not know whether your</p>
<p>son is alive or dead,</p>
<p>and it is not right to talk when one does not</p>
<p>know.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs we two sat weeping and talking thus sadly with one another the</p>
<p>ghost of Achilles came up to us with Patroclus,</p>
<p>Antilochus,</p>
<p>and Ajax</p>
<p>who was the finest and goodliest man of all the Danaans after the son</p>
<p>of Peleus. The fleet descendant of Aeacus knew me and spoke piteously,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>what deed of daring will you</p>
<p>undertake next,</p>
<p>that you venture down to the house of Hades among us</p>
<p>silly dead,</p>
<p>who are but the ghosts of them that can labour no more?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAchilles,</p>
<p>son of Peleus,</p>
<p>foremost champion of the</p>
<p>Achaeans,</p>
<p>I came to consult Teiresias,</p>
<p>and see if he could advise me</p>
<p>about my return home to Ithaca,</p>
<p>for I have never yet been able to get</p>
<p>near the Achaean land,</p>
<p>nor to set foot in my own country,</p>
<p>but have been</p>
<p>in trouble all the time. As for you,</p>
<p>Achilles,</p>
<p>no one was ever yet so</p>
<p>fortunate as you have been,</p>
<p>nor ever will be,</p>
<p>for you were adored by</p>
<p>all us Argives as long as you were alive,</p>
<p>and now that you are here you</p>
<p>are a great prince among the dead. Do not,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>take it so much</p>
<p>to heart even if you are dead.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòSay not a word,</p>
<p>‚Äô he answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòin death‚Äôs favour; I would rather be a</p>
<p>paid servant in a poor man‚Äôs house and be above ground than king of</p>
<p>kings among the dead. But give me news about my son; is he gone to the</p>
<p>wars and will he be a great soldier,</p>
<p>or is this not so? Tell me also if</p>
<p>you have heard anything about my father Peleus‚Äîdoes he still rule among</p>
<p>the Myrmidons,</p>
<p>or do they show him no respect throughout Hellas and</p>
<p>Phthia now that he is old and his limbs fail him? Could I but stand by</p>
<p>his side,</p>
<p>in the light of day,</p>
<p>with the same strength that I had when I</p>
<p>killed the bravest of our foes upon the plain of Troy‚Äîcould I but be as</p>
<p>I then was and go even for a short time to my father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>any one</p>
<p>who tried to do him violence or supersede him would soon rue it.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòI have heard nothing,</p>
<p>‚Äô I answered,</p>
<p>‚Äòof Peleus,</p>
<p>but I can tell you all</p>
<p>about your son Neoptolemus,</p>
<p>for I took him in my own ship from Scyros</p>
<p>with the Achaeans. In our councils of war before Troy he was always</p>
<p>first to speak,</p>
<p>and his judgement was unerring. Nestor and I were the</p>
<p>only two who could surpass him; and when it came to fighting on the</p>
<p>plain of Troy,</p>
<p>he would never remain with the body of his men,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>would dash on far in front,</p>
<p>foremost of them all in valour. Many a man</p>
<p>did he kill in battle‚ÄîI cannot name every single one of those whom he</p>
<p>slew while fighting on the side of the Argives,</p>
<p>but will only say how</p>
<p>he killed that valiant hero Eurypylus son of Telephus,</p>
<p>who was the</p>
<p>handsomest man I ever saw except Memnon; many others also of the</p>
<p>Ceteians fell around him by reason of a woman‚Äôs bribes. Moreover,</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>all the bravest of the Argives went inside the horse that Epeus had</p>
<p>made,</p>
<p>and it was left to me to settle when we should either open the</p>
<p>door of our ambuscade,</p>
<p>or close it,</p>
<p>though all the other leaders and</p>
<p>chief men among the Danaans were drying their eyes and quaking in every</p>
<p>limb,</p>
<p>I never once saw him turn pale nor wipe a tear from his cheek; he</p>
<p>was all the time urging me to break out from the horse‚Äîgrasping the</p>
<p>handle of his sword and his bronze-shod spear,</p>
<p>and breathing fury</p>
<p>against the foe. Yet when we had sacked the city of Priam he got his</p>
<p>handsome share of the prize money and went on board (such is the</p>
<p>fortune of war) without a wound upon him,</p>
<p>neither from a thrown spear</p>
<p>nor in close combat,</p>
<p>for the rage of Mars is a matter of great chance.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I had told him this,</p>
<p>the ghost of Achilles strode off across a</p>
<p>meadow full of asphodel,</p>
<p>exulting over what I had said concerning the</p>
<p>prowess of his son.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ghosts of other dead men stood near me and told me each his own</p>
<p>melancholy tale; but that of Ajax son of Telamon alone held aloof‚Äîstill</p>
<p>angry with me for having won the cause in our dispute about the armour</p>
<p>of Achilles. Thetis had offered it as a prize,</p>
<p>but the Trojan prisoners</p>
<p>and Minerva were the judges. Would that I had never gained the day in</p>
<p>such a contest,</p>
<p>for it cost the life of Ajax,</p>
<p>who was foremost of all</p>
<p>the Danaans after the son of Peleus,</p>
<p>alike in stature and prowess.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen I saw him I tried to pacify him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòAjax,</p>
<p>will you not</p>
<p>forget and forgive even in death,</p>
<p>but must the judgement about that</p>
<p>hateful armour still rankle with you? It cost us Argives dear enough to</p>
<p>lose such a tower of strength as you were to us. We mourned you as much</p>
<p>as we mourned Achilles son of Peleus himself,</p>
<p>nor can the blame be laid</p>
<p>on anything but on the spite which Jove bore against the Danaans,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>it was this that made him counsel your destruction‚Äîcome hither,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>bring your proud spirit into subjection,</p>
<p>and hear what I can</p>
<p>tell you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe would not answer,</p>
<p>but turned away to Erebus and to the other</p>
<p>ghosts; nevertheless,</p>
<p>I should have made him talk to me in spite of his</p>
<p>being so angry,</p>
<p>or I should have gone on talking to him,</p>
<p>97 only that</p>
<p>there were still others among the dead whom I desired to see.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen I saw Minos son of Jove with his golden sceptre in his hand</p>
<p>sitting in judgement on the dead,</p>
<p>and the ghosts were gathered sitting</p>
<p>and standing round him in the spacious house of Hades,</p>
<p>to learn his</p>
<p>sentences upon them.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter him I saw huge Orion in a meadow full of asphodel driving the</p>
<p>ghosts of the wild beasts that he had killed upon the mountains,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>had a great bronze club in his hand,</p>
<p>unbreakable for ever and ever.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I saw Tityus son of Gaia stretched upon the plain and covering</p>
<p>some nine acres of ground. Two vultures on either side of him were</p>
<p>digging their beaks into his liver,</p>
<p>and he kept on trying to beat them</p>
<p>off with his hands,</p>
<p>but could not; for he had violated Jove‚Äôs mistress</p>
<p>Leto as she was going through Panopeus on her way to Pytho.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI saw also the dreadful fate of Tantalus,</p>
<p>who stood in a lake that</p>
<p>reached his chin; he was dying to quench his thirst,</p>
<p>but could never</p>
<p>reach the water,</p>
<p>for whenever the poor creature stooped to drink,</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>dried up and vanished,</p>
<p>so that there was nothing but dry ground‚Äîparched</p>
<p>by the spite of heaven. There were tall trees,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>that shed</p>
<p>their fruit over his head‚Äîpears,</p>
<p>pomegranates,</p>
<p>apples,</p>
<p>sweet figs and</p>
<p>juicy olives,</p>
<p>but whenever the poor creature stretched out his hand to</p>
<p>take some,</p>
<p>the wind tossed the branches back again to the clouds.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd I saw Sisyphus at his endless task raising his prodigious stone</p>
<p>with both his hands. With hands and feet he tried to roll it up to the</p>
<p>top of the hill,</p>
<p>but always,</p>
<p>just before he could roll it over on to</p>
<p>the other side,</p>
<p>its weight would be too much for him,</p>
<p>and the pitiless</p>
<p>stone98 would come thundering down again on to the plain. Then he would</p>
<p>begin trying to push it up hill again,</p>
<p>and the sweat ran off him and</p>
<p>the steam rose after him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter him I saw mighty Hercules,</p>
<p>but it was his phantom only,</p>
<p>for he</p>
<p>is feasting ever with the immortal gods,</p>
<p>and has lovely Hebe to wife,</p>
<p>who is daughter of Jove and Juno. The ghosts were screaming round him</p>
<p>like scared birds flying all whithers. He looked black as night with</p>
<p>his bare bow in his hands and his arrow on the string,</p>
<p>glaring around</p>
<p>as though ever on the point of taking aim. About his breast there was a</p>
<p>wondrous golden belt adorned in the most marvellous fashion with bears,</p>
<p>wild boars,</p>
<p>and lions with gleaming eyes; there was also war,</p>
<p>battle,</p>
<p>and death. The man who made that belt,</p>
<p>do what he might,</p>
<p>would never be</p>
<p>able to make another like it. Hercules knew me at once when he saw me,</p>
<p>and spoke piteously,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy poor Ulysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>are you too leading the same sorry kind of life that I did when I was</p>
<p>above ground? I was son of Jove,</p>
<p>but I went through an infinity of</p>
<p>suffering,</p>
<p>for I became bondsman to one who was far beneath me‚Äîa low</p>
<p>fellow who set me all manner of labours. He once sent me here to fetch</p>
<p>the hell-hound‚Äîfor he did not think he could find anything harder for</p>
<p>me than this,</p>
<p>but I got the hound out of Hades and brought him to him,</p>
<p>for Mercury and Minerva helped me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this Hercules went down again into the house of Hades,</p>
<p>but I stayed</p>
<p>where I was in case some other of the mighty dead should come to me.</p>
<p>And I should have seen still other of them that are gone before,</p>
<p>whom I</p>
<p>would fain have seen‚ÄîTheseus and Pirithous‚Äîglorious children of the</p>
<p>gods,</p>
<p>but so many thousands of ghosts came round me and uttered such</p>
<p>appalling cries,</p>
<p>that I was panic stricken lest Proserpine should send</p>
<p>up from the house of Hades the head of that awful monster Gorgon. On</p>
<p>this I hastened back to my ship and ordered my men to go on board at</p>
<p>once and loose the hawsers; so they embarked and took their places,</p>
<p>whereon the ship went down the stream of the river Oceanus. We had to</p>
<p>row at first,</p>
<p>but presently a fair wind sprang up.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XII</span>
<p>THE SIRENS,</p>
<p>SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS,</p>
<p>THE CATTLE OF THE SUN.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAfter we were clear of the river Oceanus,</p>
<p>and had got out into the</p>
<p>open sea,</p>
<p>we went on till we reached the Aeaean island where there is</p>
<p>dawn and sun-rise as in other places. We then drew our ship on to the</p>
<p>sands and got out of her on to the shore,</p>
<p>where we went to sleep and</p>
<p>waited till day should break.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,</p>
<p>when the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>I sent</p>
<p>some men to Circe‚Äôs house to fetch the body of Elpenor. We cut firewood</p>
<p>from a wood where the headland jutted out into the sea,</p>
<p>and after we</p>
<p>had wept over him and lamented him we performed his funeral rites. When</p>
<p>his body and armour had been burned to ashes,</p>
<p>we raised a cairn,</p>
<p>set a</p>
<p>stone over it,</p>
<p>and at the top of the cairn we fixed the oar that he had</p>
<p>been used to row with.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhile we were doing all this,</p>
<p>Circe,</p>
<p>who knew that we had got back</p>
<p>from the house of Hades,</p>
<p>dressed herself and came to us as fast as she</p>
<p>could; and her maid servants came with her bringing us bread,</p>
<p>meat,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>wine. Then she stood in the midst of us and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòYou have done a bold</p>
<p>thing in going down alive to the house of Hades,</p>
<p>and you will have died</p>
<p>twice,</p>
<p>to other people‚Äôs once; now,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>stay here for the rest of the</p>
<p>day,</p>
<p>feast your fill,</p>
<p>and go on with your voyage at daybreak tomorrow</p>
<p>morning. In the meantime I will tell Ulysses about your course,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>will explain everything to him so as to prevent your suffering from</p>
<p>misadventure either by land or sea.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe agreed to do as she had said,</p>
<p>and feasted through the livelong day</p>
<p>to the going down of the sun,</p>
<p>but when the sun had set and it came on</p>
<p>dark,</p>
<p>the men laid themselves down to sleep by the stern cables of the</p>
<p>ship. Then Circe took me by the hand and bade me be seated away from</p>
<p>the others,</p>
<p>while she reclined by my side and asked me all about our</p>
<p>adventures.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòSo far so good,</p>
<p>‚Äô said she,</p>
<p>when I had ended my story,</p>
<p>‚Äòand now pay</p>
<p>attention to what I am about to tell you‚Äîheaven itself,</p>
<p>indeed,</p>
<p>will</p>
<p>recall it to your recollection. First you will come to the Sirens who</p>
<p>enchant all who come near them. If any one unwarily draws in too close</p>
<p>and hears the singing of the Sirens,</p>
<p>his wife and children will never</p>
<p>welcome him home again,</p>
<p>for they sit in a green field and warble him to</p>
<p>death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead</p>
<p>men‚Äôs bones lying all around,</p>
<p>with the flesh still rotting off them.</p>
<p>Therefore pass these Sirens by,</p>
<p>and stop your men‚Äôs ears with wax that</p>
<p>none of them may hear; but if you like you can listen yourself,</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross piece half</p>
<p>way up the mast,</p>
<p>99 and they must lash the rope‚Äôs ends to the mast</p>
<p>itself,</p>
<p>that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and</p>
<p>pray the men to unloose you,</p>
<p>then they must bind you faster.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòWhen your crew have taken you past these Sirens,</p>
<p>I cannot give you</p>
<p>coherent directions100 as to which of two courses you are to take; I</p>
<p>will lay the two alternatives before you,</p>
<p>and you must consider them</p>
<p>for yourself. On the one hand there are some overhanging rocks against</p>
<p>which the deep blue waves of Amphitrite beat with terrific fury; the</p>
<p>blessed gods call these rocks the Wanderers. Here not even a bird may</p>
<p>pass,</p>
<p>no,</p>
<p>not even the timid doves that bring ambrosia to Father Jove,</p>
<p>but the sheer rock always carries off one of them,</p>
<p>and Father Jove has</p>
<p>to send another to make up their number; no ship that ever yet came to</p>
<p>these rocks has got away again,</p>
<p>but the waves and whirlwinds of fire</p>
<p>are freighted with wreckage and with the bodies of dead men. The only</p>
<p>vessel that ever sailed and got through,</p>
<p>was the famous Argo on her way</p>
<p>from the house of Aetes,</p>
<p>and she too would have gone against these</p>
<p>great rocks,</p>
<p>only that Juno piloted her past them for the love she bore</p>
<p>to Jason.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòOf these two rocks the one reaches heaven and its peak is lost in a</p>
<p>dark cloud. This never leaves it,</p>
<p>so that the top is never clear not</p>
<p>even in summer and early autumn. No man though he had twenty hands and</p>
<p>twenty feet could get a foothold on it and climb it,</p>
<p>for it runs sheer</p>
<p>up,</p>
<p>as smooth as though it had been polished. In the middle of it there</p>
<p>is a large cavern,</p>
<p>looking West and turned towards Erebus; you must</p>
<p>take your ship this way,</p>
<p>but the cave is so high up that not even the</p>
<p>stoutest archer could send an arrow into it. Inside it Scylla sits and</p>
<p>yelps with a voice that you might take to be that of a young hound,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>in truth she is a dreadful monster and no one‚Äînot even a god‚Äîcould face</p>
<p>her without being terror-struck. She has twelve mis-shapen feet,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>six necks of the most prodigious length; and at the end of each neck</p>
<p>she has a frightful head with three rows of teeth in each,</p>
<p>all set very</p>
<p>close together,</p>
<p>so that they would crunch any one to death in a moment,</p>
<p>and she sits deep within her shady cell thrusting out her heads and</p>
<p>peering all round the rock,</p>
<p>fishing for dolphins or dogfish or any</p>
<p>larger monster that she can catch,</p>
<p>of the thousands with which</p>
<p>Amphitrite teems. No ship ever yet got past her without losing some</p>
<p>men,</p>
<p>for she shoots out all her heads at once,</p>
<p>and carries off a man in</p>
<p>each mouth.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou will find the other rock lie lower,</p>
<p>but they are so close</p>
<p>together that there is not more than a bow-shot between them. [A large</p>
<p>fig tree in full leaf101 grows upon it],</p>
<p>and under it lies the sucking</p>
<p>whirlpool of Charybdis. Three times in the day does she vomit forth her</p>
<p>waters,</p>
<p>and three times she sucks them down again; see that you be not</p>
<p>there when she is sucking,</p>
<p>for if you are,</p>
<p>Neptune himself could not</p>
<p>save you; you must hug the Scylla side and drive ship by as fast as you</p>
<p>can,</p>
<p>for you had better lose six men than your whole crew.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòIs there no way,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòof escaping Charybdis,</p>
<p>and at the same</p>
<p>time keeping Scylla off when she is trying to harm my men?‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou dare devil,</p>
<p>‚Äô replied the goddess,</p>
<p>‚Äòyou are always wanting to</p>
<p>fight somebody or something; you will not let yourself be beaten even</p>
<p>by the immortals. For Scylla is not mortal; moreover she is savage,</p>
<p>extreme,</p>
<p>rude,</p>
<p>cruel and invincible. There is no help for it; your best</p>
<p>chance will be to get by her as fast as ever you can,</p>
<p>for if you dawdle</p>
<p>about her rock while you are putting on your armour,</p>
<p>she may catch you</p>
<p>with a second cast of her six heads,</p>
<p>and snap up another half dozen of</p>
<p>your men; so drive your ship past her at full speed,</p>
<p>and roar out</p>
<p>lustily to Crataiis who is Scylla‚Äôs dam,</p>
<p>bad luck to her; she will then</p>
<p>stop her from making a second raid upon you.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòYou will now come to the Thrinacian island,</p>
<p>and here you will see</p>
<p>many herds of cattle and flocks of sheep belonging to the sun-god‚Äîseven</p>
<p>herds of cattle and seven flocks of sheep,</p>
<p>with fifty head in each</p>
<p>flock. They do not breed,</p>
<p>nor do they become fewer in number,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>are tended by the goddesses Phaethusa and Lampetie,</p>
<p>who are children of</p>
<p>the sun-god Hyperion by Neaera. Their mother when she had borne them</p>
<p>and had done suckling them sent them to the Thrinacian island,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>was a long way off,</p>
<p>to live there and look after their father‚Äôs flocks</p>
<p>and herds. If you leave these flocks unharmed,</p>
<p>and think of nothing but</p>
<p>getting home,</p>
<p>you may yet after much hardship reach Ithaca; but if you</p>
<p>harm them,</p>
<p>then I forewarn you of the destruction both of your ship and</p>
<p>of your comrades; and even though you may yourself escape,</p>
<p>you will</p>
<p>return late,</p>
<p>in bad plight,</p>
<p>after losing all your men.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere she ended,</p>
<p>and dawn enthroned in gold began to show in heaven,</p>
<p>whereon she returned inland. I then went on board and told my men to</p>
<p>loose the ship from her moorings; so they at once got into her,</p>
<p>took</p>
<p>their places,</p>
<p>and began to smite the grey sea with their oars.</p>
<p>Presently the great and cunning goddess Circe befriended us with a fair</p>
<p>wind that blew dead aft,</p>
<p>and staid steadily with us,</p>
<p>keeping our sails</p>
<p>well filled,</p>
<p>so we did whatever wanted doing to the ship‚Äôs gear,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>let her go as wind and helmsman headed her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen,</p>
<p>being much troubled in mind,</p>
<p>I said to my men,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy friends,</p>
<p>it</p>
<p>is not right that one or two of us alone should know the prophecies</p>
<p>that Circe has made me,</p>
<p>I will therefore tell you about them,</p>
<p>so that</p>
<p>whether we live or die we may do so with our eyes open. First she said</p>
<p>we were to keep clear of the Sirens,</p>
<p>who sit and sing most beautifully</p>
<p>in a field of flowers; but she said I might hear them myself so long as</p>
<p>no one else did. Therefore,</p>
<p>take me and bind me to the crosspiece half</p>
<p>way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright,</p>
<p>with a bond so fast that I</p>
<p>cannot possibly break away,</p>
<p>and lash the rope‚Äôs ends to the mast</p>
<p>itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free,</p>
<p>then bind me more tightly</p>
<p>still.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had hardly finished telling everything to the men before we reached</p>
<p>the island of the two Sirens,</p>
<p>102 for the wind had been very favourable.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden it fell dead calm; there was not a breath of wind</p>
<p>nor a ripple upon the water,</p>
<p>so the men furled the sails and stowed</p>
<p>them; then taking to their oars they whitened the water with the foam</p>
<p>they raised in rowing. Meanwhile I look a large wheel of wax and cut it</p>
<p>up small with my sword. Then I kneaded the wax in my strong hands till</p>
<p>it became soft,</p>
<p>which it soon did between the kneading and the rays of</p>
<p>the sun-god son of Hyperion. Then I stopped the ears of all my men,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they bound me hands and feet to the mast as I stood upright on the</p>
<p>cross piece; but they went on rowing themselves. When we had got within</p>
<p>earshot of the land,</p>
<p>and the ship was going at a good rate,</p>
<p>the Sirens</p>
<p>saw that we were getting in shore and began with their singing.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòCome here,</p>
<p>‚Äô they sang,</p>
<p>‚Äòrenowned Ulysses,</p>
<p>honour to the Achaean name,</p>
<p>and listen to our two voices. No one ever sailed past us without</p>
<p>staying to hear the enchanting sweetness of our song‚Äîand he who listens</p>
<p>will go on his way not only charmed,</p>
<p>but wiser,</p>
<p>for we know all the</p>
<p>ills that the gods laid upon the Argives and Trojans before Troy,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>can tell you everything that is going to happen over the whole world.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey sang these words most musically,</p>
<p>and as I longed to hear them</p>
<p>further I made signs by frowning to my men that they should set me</p>
<p>free; but they quickened their stroke,</p>
<p>and Eurylochus and Perimedes</p>
<p>bound me with still stronger bonds till we had got out of hearing of</p>
<p>the Sirens‚Äô voices. Then my men took the wax from their ears and</p>
<p>unbound me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúImmediately after we had got past the island I saw a great wave from</p>
<p>which spray was rising,</p>
<p>and I heard a loud roaring sound. The men were</p>
<p>so frightened that they loosed hold of their oars,</p>
<p>for the whole sea</p>
<p>resounded with the rushing of the waters,</p>
<p>103 but the ship stayed where</p>
<p>it was,</p>
<p>for the men had left off rowing. I went round,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>exhorted them man by man not to lose heart.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòthis is not the first time that we have been in</p>
<p>danger,</p>
<p>and we are in nothing like so bad a case as when the Cyclops</p>
<p>shut us up in his cave; nevertheless,</p>
<p>my courage and wise counsel saved</p>
<p>us then,</p>
<p>and we shall live to look back on all this as well. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>let us all do as I say,</p>
<p>trust in Jove and row on with might</p>
<p>and main. As for you,</p>
<p>coxswain,</p>
<p>these are your orders; attend to them,</p>
<p>for the ship is in your hands; turn her head away from these steaming</p>
<p>rapids and hug the rock,</p>
<p>or she will give you the slip and be over</p>
<p>yonder before you know where you are,</p>
<p>and you will be the death of us.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo they did as I told them; but I said nothing about the awful monster</p>
<p>Scylla,</p>
<p>for I knew the men would not go on rowing if I did,</p>
<p>but would</p>
<p>huddle together in the hold. In one thing only did I disobey Circe‚Äôs</p>
<p>strict instructions‚ÄîI put on my armour. Then seizing two strong spears</p>
<p>I took my stand on the ship‚Äôs bows,</p>
<p>for it was there that I expected</p>
<p>first to see the monster of the rock,</p>
<p>who was to do my men so much</p>
<p>harm; but I could not make her out anywhere,</p>
<p>though I strained my eyes</p>
<p>with looking the gloomy rock all over and over.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen we entered the Straits in great fear of mind,</p>
<p>for on the one hand</p>
<p>was Scylla,</p>
<p>and on the other dread Charybdis kept sucking up the salt</p>
<p>water. As she vomited it up,</p>
<p>it was like the water in a cauldron when</p>
<p>it is boiling over upon a great fire,</p>
<p>and the spray reached the top of</p>
<p>the rocks on either side. When she began to suck again,</p>
<p>we could see</p>
<p>the water all inside whirling round and round,</p>
<p>and it made a deafening</p>
<p>sound as it broke against the rocks. We could see the bottom of the</p>
<p>whirlpool all black with sand and mud,</p>
<p>and the men were at their wits</p>
<p>ends for fear. While we were taken up with this,</p>
<p>and were expecting</p>
<p>each moment to be our last,</p>
<p>Scylla pounced down suddenly upon us and</p>
<p>snatched up my six best men. I was looking at once after both ship and</p>
<p>men,</p>
<p>and in a moment I saw their hands and feet ever so high above me,</p>
<p>struggling in the air as Scylla was carrying them off,</p>
<p>and I heard them</p>
<p>call out my name in one last despairing cry. As a fisherman,</p>
<p>seated,</p>
<p>spear in hand,</p>
<p>upon some jutting rock104 throws bait into the water to</p>
<p>deceive the poor little fishes,</p>
<p>and spears them with the ox‚Äôs horn with</p>
<p>which his spear is shod,</p>
<p>throwing them gasping on to the land as he</p>
<p>catches them one by one‚Äîeven so did Scylla land these panting creatures</p>
<p>on her rock and munch them up at the mouth of her den,</p>
<p>while they</p>
<p>screamed and stretched out their hands to me in their mortal agony.</p>
<p>This was the most sickening sight that I saw throughout all my voyages.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhen we had passed the [Wandering] rocks,</p>
<p>with Scylla and terrible</p>
<p>Charybdis,</p>
<p>we reached the noble island of the sun-god,</p>
<p>where were the</p>
<p>goodly cattle and sheep belonging to the sun Hyperion. While still at</p>
<p>sea in my ship I could bear the cattle lowing as they came home to the</p>
<p>yards,</p>
<p>and the sheep bleating. Then I remembered what the blind Theban</p>
<p>prophet Teiresias had told me,</p>
<p>and how carefully Aeaean Circe had</p>
<p>warned me to shun the island of the blessed sun-god. So being much</p>
<p>troubled I said to the men,</p>
<p>‚ÄòMy men,</p>
<p>I know you are hard pressed,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>listen while I tell you the prophecy that Teiresias made me,</p>
<p>and how</p>
<p>carefully Aeaean Circe warned me to shun the island of the blessed</p>
<p>sun-god,</p>
<p>for it was here,</p>
<p>she said,</p>
<p>that our worst danger would lie.</p>
<p>Head the ship,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>away from the island.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe men were in despair at this,</p>
<p>and Eurylochus at once gave me an</p>
<p>insolent answer. ‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚Äòyou are cruel; you are very</p>
<p>strong yourself and never get worn out; you seem to be made of iron,</p>
<p>and now,</p>
<p>though your men are exhausted with toil and want of sleep,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>will not let them land and cook themselves a good supper upon this</p>
<p>island,</p>
<p>but bid them put out to sea and go faring fruitlessly on</p>
<p>through the watches of the flying night. It is by night that the winds</p>
<p>blow hardest and do so much damage; how can we escape should one of</p>
<p>those sudden squalls spring up from South West or West,</p>
<p>which so often</p>
<p>wreck a vessel when our lords the gods are unpropitious? Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>let us obey the behests of night and prepare our supper here</p>
<p>hard by the ship; to-morrow morning we will go on board again and put</p>
<p>out to sea.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus spoke Eurylochus,</p>
<p>and the men approved his words. I saw that</p>
<p>heaven meant us a mischief and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòYou force me to yield,</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>are many against one,</p>
<p>but at any rate each one of you must take his</p>
<p>solemn oath that if he meet with a herd of cattle or a large flock of</p>
<p>sheep,</p>
<p>he will not be so mad as to kill a single head of either,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>will be satisfied with the food that Circe has given us.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey all swore as I bade them,</p>
<p>and when they had completed their oath</p>
<p>we made the ship fast in a harbour that was near a stream of fresh</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>and the men went ashore and cooked their suppers. As soon as</p>
<p>they had had enough to eat and drink,</p>
<p>they began talking about their</p>
<p>poor comrades whom Scylla had snatched up and eaten; this set them</p>
<p>weeping and they went on crying till they fell off into a sound sleep.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the third watch of the night when the stars had shifted their</p>
<p>places,</p>
<p>Jove raised a great gale of wind that flew a hurricane so that</p>
<p>land and sea were covered with thick clouds,</p>
<p>and night sprang forth out</p>
<p>of the heavens. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>we brought the ship to land and drew her into a cave wherein</p>
<p>the sea-nymphs hold their courts and dances,</p>
<p>and I called the men</p>
<p>together in council.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòwe have meat and drink in the ship,</p>
<p>let us</p>
<p>mind,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and not touch the cattle,</p>
<p>or we shall suffer for it;</p>
<p>for these cattle and sheep belong to the mighty sun,</p>
<p>who sees and gives</p>
<p>ear to everything.‚Äô And again they promised that they would obey.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor a whole month the wind blew steadily from the South,</p>
<p>and there was</p>
<p>no other wind,</p>
<p>but only South and East.105 As long as corn and wine</p>
<p>held out the men did not touch the cattle when they were hungry; when,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>they had eaten all there was in the ship,</p>
<p>they were forced to</p>
<p>go further afield,</p>
<p>with hook and line,</p>
<p>catching birds,</p>
<p>and taking</p>
<p>whatever they could lay their hands on; for they were starving. One</p>
<p>day,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>I went up inland that I might pray heaven to show me</p>
<p>some means of getting away. When I had gone far enough to be clear of</p>
<p>all my men,</p>
<p>and had found a place that was well sheltered from the</p>
<p>wind,</p>
<p>I washed my hands and prayed to all the gods in Olympus till by</p>
<p>and by they sent me off into a sweet sleep.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile Eurylochus had been giving evil counsel to the men,</p>
<p>‚ÄòListen</p>
<p>to me,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚Äòmy poor comrades. All deaths are bad enough but there</p>
<p>is none so bad as famine. Why should not we drive in the best of these</p>
<p>cows and offer them in sacrifice to the immortal gods? If we ever get</p>
<p>back to Ithaca,</p>
<p>we can build a fine temple to the sun-god and enrich it</p>
<p>with every kind of ornament; if,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>he is determined to sink our</p>
<p>ship out of revenge for these horned cattle,</p>
<p>and the other gods are of</p>
<p>the same mind,</p>
<p>I for one would rather drink salt water once for all and</p>
<p>have done with it,</p>
<p>than be starved to death by inches in such a desert</p>
<p>island as this is.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus spoke Eurylochus,</p>
<p>and the men approved his words. Now the cattle,</p>
<p>so fair and goodly,</p>
<p>were feeding not far from the ship; the men,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>drove in the best of them,</p>
<p>and they all stood round them</p>
<p>saying their prayers,</p>
<p>and using young oak-shoots instead of</p>
<p>barley-meal,</p>
<p>for there was no barley left. When they had done praying</p>
<p>they killed the cows and dressed their carcasses; they cut out the</p>
<p>thigh bones,</p>
<p>wrapped them round in two layers of fat,</p>
<p>and set some</p>
<p>pieces of raw meat on top of them. They had no wine with which to make</p>
<p>drink-offerings over the sacrifice while it was cooking,</p>
<p>so they kept</p>
<p>pouring on a little water from time to time while the inward meats were</p>
<p>being grilled; then,</p>
<p>when the thigh bones were burned and they had</p>
<p>tasted the inward meats,</p>
<p>they cut the rest up small and put the pieces</p>
<p>upon the spits.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy this time my deep sleep had left me,</p>
<p>and I turned back to the ship</p>
<p>and to the sea shore. As I drew near I began to smell hot roast meat,</p>
<p>so I groaned out a prayer to the immortal gods. ‚ÄòFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äô I</p>
<p>exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äòand all you other gods who live in everlasting bliss,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>have done me a cruel mischief by the sleep into which you have sent me;</p>
<p>see what fine work these men of mine have been making in my absence.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúMeanwhile Lampetie went straight off to the sun and told him we had</p>
<p>been killing his cows,</p>
<p>whereon he flew into a great rage,</p>
<p>and said to</p>
<p>the immortals,</p>
<p>‚ÄòFather Jove,</p>
<p>and all you other gods who live in</p>
<p>everlasting bliss,</p>
<p>I must have vengeance on the crew of Ulysses‚Äô ship:</p>
<p>they have had the insolence to kill my cows,</p>
<p>which were the one thing I</p>
<p>loved to look upon,</p>
<p>whether I was going up heaven or down again. If</p>
<p>they do not square accounts with me about my cows,</p>
<p>I will go down to</p>
<p>Hades and shine there among the dead.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòSun,</p>
<p>‚Äô said Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äògo on shining upon us gods and upon mankind over</p>
<p>the fruitful earth. I will shiver their ship into little pieces with a</p>
<p>bolt of white lightning as soon as they get out to sea.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was told all this by Calypso,</p>
<p>who said she had heard it from the</p>
<p>mouth of Mercury.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs soon as I got down to my ship and to the sea shore I rebuked each</p>
<p>one of the men separately,</p>
<p>but we could see no way out of it,</p>
<p>for the</p>
<p>cows were dead already. And indeed the gods began at once to show signs</p>
<p>and wonders among us,</p>
<p>for the hides of the cattle crawled about,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the joints upon the spits began to low like cows,</p>
<p>and the meat,</p>
<p>whether</p>
<p>cooked or raw,</p>
<p>kept on making a noise just as cows do.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor six days my men kept driving in the best cows and feasting upon</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>but when Jove the son of Saturn had added a seventh day,</p>
<p>the fury</p>
<p>of the gale abated; we therefore went on board,</p>
<p>raised our masts,</p>
<p>spread sail,</p>
<p>and put out to sea. As soon as we were well away from the</p>
<p>island,</p>
<p>and could see nothing but sky and sea,</p>
<p>the son of Saturn raised</p>
<p>a black cloud over our ship,</p>
<p>and the sea grew dark beneath it. We did</p>
<p>not get on much further,</p>
<p>for in another moment we were caught by a</p>
<p>terrific squall from the West that snapped the forestays of the mast so</p>
<p>that it fell aft,</p>
<p>while all the ship‚Äôs gear tumbled about at the bottom</p>
<p>of the vessel. The mast fell upon the head of the helmsman in the</p>
<p>ship‚Äôs stern,</p>
<p>so that the bones of his head were crushed to pieces,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he fell overboard as though he were diving,</p>
<p>with no more life left in</p>
<p>him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen Jove let fly with his thunderbolts,</p>
<p>and the ship went round and</p>
<p>round,</p>
<p>and was filled with fire and brimstone as the lightning struck</p>
<p>it. The men all fell into the sea; they were carried about in the water</p>
<p>round the ship,</p>
<p>looking like so many sea-gulls,</p>
<p>but the god presently</p>
<p>deprived them of all chance of getting home again.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stuck to the ship till the sea knocked her sides from her keel</p>
<p>(which drifted about by itself) and struck the mast out of her in the</p>
<p>direction of the keel; but there was a backstay of stout ox-thong still</p>
<p>hanging about it,</p>
<p>and with this I lashed the mast and keel together,</p>
<p>and getting astride of them was carried wherever the winds chose to</p>
<p>take me.</p>
<p>‚Äú[The gale from the West had now spent its force,</p>
<p>and the wind got into</p>
<p>the South again,</p>
<p>which frightened me lest I should be taken back to the</p>
<p>terrible whirlpool of Charybdis. This indeed was what actually</p>
<p>happened,</p>
<p>for I was borne along by the waves all night,</p>
<p>and by sunrise</p>
<p>had reached the rock of Scylla,</p>
<p>and the whirlpool. She was then sucking</p>
<p>down the salt sea water,</p>
<p>106 but I was carried aloft toward the fig</p>
<p>tree,</p>
<p>which I caught hold of and clung on to like a bat. I could not</p>
<p>plant my feet anywhere so as to stand securely,</p>
<p>for the roots were a</p>
<p>long way off and the boughs that overshadowed the whole pool were too</p>
<p>high,</p>
<p>too vast,</p>
<p>and too far apart for me to reach them; so I hung</p>
<p>patiently on,</p>
<p>waiting till the pool should discharge my mast and raft</p>
<p>again‚Äîand a very long while it seemed. A jury-man is not more glad to</p>
<p>get home to supper,</p>
<p>after having been long detained in court by</p>
<p>troublesome cases,</p>
<p>than I was to see my raft beginning to work its way</p>
<p>out of the whirlpool again. At last I let go with my hands and feet,</p>
<p>and fell heavily into the sea,</p>
<p>hard by my raft on to which I then got,</p>
<p>and began to row with my hands. As for Scylla,</p>
<p>the father of gods and</p>
<p>men would not let her get further sight of me‚Äîotherwise I should have</p>
<p>certainly been lost.107</p>
<p>‚ÄúHence I was carried along for nine days till on the tenth night the</p>
<p>gods stranded me on the Ogygian island,</p>
<p>where dwells the great and</p>
<p>powerful goddess Calypso. She took me in and was kind to me,</p>
<p>but I need</p>
<p>say no more about this,</p>
<p>for I told you and your noble wife all about it</p>
<p>yesterday,</p>
<p>and I hate saying the same thing over and over again.‚Äù</p>

<p>ULYSSES LEAVES SCHERIA AND RETURNS TO ITHACA.</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they all held their peace throughout the covered</p>
<p>cloister,</p>
<p>enthralled by the charm of his story,</p>
<p>till presently Alcinous</p>
<p>began to speak.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúnow that you have reached my house I doubt not you</p>
<p>will get home without further misadventure no matter how much you have</p>
<p>suffered in the past. To you others,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>who come here night after</p>
<p>night to drink my choicest wine and listen to my bard,</p>
<p>I would insist</p>
<p>as follows. Our guest has already packed up the clothes,</p>
<p>wrought</p>
<p>gold,</p>
<p>108 and other valuables which you have brought for his acceptance;</p>
<p>let us now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>present him further,</p>
<p>each one of us,</p>
<p>with a</p>
<p>large tripod and a cauldron. We will recoup ourselves by the levy of a</p>
<p>general rate; for private individuals cannot be expected to bear the</p>
<p>burden of such a handsome present.‚Äù</p>
<p>Every one approved of this,</p>
<p>and then they went home to bed each in his</p>
<p>own abode. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared they</p>
<p>hurried down to the ship and brought their cauldrons with them.</p>
<p>Alcinous went on board and saw everything so securely stowed under the</p>
<p>ship‚Äôs benches that nothing could break adrift and injure the rowers.</p>
<p>Then they went to the house of Alcinous to get dinner,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>sacrificed a bull for them in honour of Jove who is the lord of all.</p>
<p>They set the steaks to grill and made an excellent dinner,</p>
<p>after which</p>
<p>the inspired bard,</p>
<p>Demodocus,</p>
<p>who was a favourite with every one,</p>
<p>sang</p>
<p>to them; but Ulysses kept on turning his eyes towards the sun,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>though to hasten his setting,</p>
<p>for he was longing to be on his way. As</p>
<p>one who has been all day ploughing a fallow field with a couple of oxen</p>
<p>keeps thinking about his supper and is glad when night comes that he</p>
<p>may go and get it,</p>
<p>for it is all his legs can do to carry him,</p>
<p>even so</p>
<p>did Ulysses rejoice when the sun went down,</p>
<p>and he at once said to the</p>
<p>Phaeacians,</p>
<p>addressing himself more particularly to King Alcinous:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>and all of you,</p>
<p>farewell. Make your drink-offerings and send me</p>
<p>on my way rejoicing,</p>
<p>for you have fulfilled my heart‚Äôs desire by giving</p>
<p>me an escort,</p>
<p>and making me presents,</p>
<p>which heaven grant that I may</p>
<p>turn to good account; may I find my admirable wife living in peace</p>
<p>among friends,</p>
<p>109 and may you whom I leave behind me give satisfaction</p>
<p>to your wives and children;110 may heaven vouchsafe you every good</p>
<p>grace,</p>
<p>and may no evil thing come among your people.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak. His hearers all of them approved his saying and</p>
<p>agreed that he should have his escort inasmuch as he had spoken</p>
<p>reasonably. Alcinous therefore said to his servant,</p>
<p>‚ÄúPontonous,</p>
<p>mix</p>
<p>some wine and hand it round to everybody,</p>
<p>that we may offer a prayer to</p>
<p>father Jove,</p>
<p>and speed our guest upon his way.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pontonous mixed the wine and handed it to every one in turn; the others</p>
<p>each from his own seat made a drink-offering to the blessed gods that</p>
<p>live in heaven,</p>
<p>but Ulysses rose and placed the double cup in the hands</p>
<p>of queen Arete.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFarewell,</p>
<p>queen,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúhenceforward and for ever,</p>
<p>till age and</p>
<p>death,</p>
<p>the common lot of mankind,</p>
<p>lay their hands upon you. I now take</p>
<p>my leave; be happy in this house with your children,</p>
<p>your people,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>with king Alcinous.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he crossed the threshold,</p>
<p>and Alcinous sent a man to</p>
<p>conduct him to his ship and to the sea shore. Arete also sent some</p>
<p>maidservants with him‚Äîone with a clean shirt and cloak,</p>
<p>another to</p>
<p>carry his strong box,</p>
<p>and a third with corn and wine. When they got to</p>
<p>the water side the crew took these things and put them on board,</p>
<p>with</p>
<p>all the meat and drink; but for Ulysses they spread a rug and a linen</p>
<p>sheet on deck that he might sleep soundly in the stern of the ship.</p>
<p>Then he too went on board and lay down without a word,</p>
<p>but the crew</p>
<p>took every man his place and loosed the hawser from the pierced stone</p>
<p>to which it had been bound. Thereon,</p>
<p>when they began rowing out to sea,</p>
<p>Ulysses fell into a deep,</p>
<p>sweet,</p>
<p>and almost deathlike slumber.111</p>
<p>The ship bounded forward on her way as a four in hand chariot flies</p>
<p>over the course when the horses feel the whip. Her prow curvetted as it</p>
<p>were the neck of a stallion,</p>
<p>and a great wave of dark blue water</p>
<p>seethed in her wake. She held steadily on her course,</p>
<p>and even a</p>
<p>falcon,</p>
<p>swiftest of all birds,</p>
<p>could not have kept pace with her. Thus,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>she cut her way through the water,</p>
<p>carrying one who was as</p>
<p>cunning as the gods,</p>
<p>but who was now sleeping peacefully,</p>
<p>forgetful of</p>
<p>all that he had suffered both on the field of battle and by the waves</p>
<p>of the weary sea.</p>
<p>When the bright star that heralds the approach of dawn began to show,</p>
<p>the ship drew near to land.112 Now there is in Ithaca a haven of the</p>
<p>old merman Phorcys,</p>
<p>which lies between two points that break the line</p>
<p>of the sea and shut the harbour in. These shelter it from the storms of</p>
<p>wind and sea that rage outside,</p>
<p>so that,</p>
<p>when once within it,</p>
<p>a ship</p>
<p>may lie without being even moored. At the head of this harbour there is</p>
<p>a large olive tree,</p>
<p>and at no great distance a fine overarching cavern</p>
<p>sacred to the nymphs who are called Naiads.113 There are mixing bowls</p>
<p>within it and wine-jars of stone,</p>
<p>and the bees hive there. Moreover,</p>
<p>there are great looms of stone on which the nymphs weave their robes of</p>
<p>sea purple‚Äîvery curious to see‚Äîand at all times there is water within</p>
<p>it. It has two entrances,</p>
<p>one facing North by which mortals can go down</p>
<p>into the cave,</p>
<p>while the other comes from the South and is more</p>
<p>mysterious; mortals cannot possibly get in by it,</p>
<p>it is the way taken</p>
<p>by the gods.</p>
<p>Into this harbour,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>they took their ship,</p>
<p>for they knew the</p>
<p>place.114 She had so much way upon her that she ran half her own length</p>
<p>on to the shore;115 when,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>they had landed,</p>
<p>the first thing</p>
<p>they did was to lift Ulysses with his rug and linen sheet out of the</p>
<p>ship,</p>
<p>and lay him down upon the sand still fast asleep. Then they took</p>
<p>out the presents which Minerva had persuaded the Phaeacians to give him</p>
<p>when he was setting out on his voyage homewards. They put these all</p>
<p>together by the root of the olive tree,</p>
<p>away from the road,</p>
<p>for fear</p>
<p>some passer by116 might come and steal them before Ulysses awoke; and</p>
<p>then they made the best of their way home again.</p>
<p>But Neptune did not forget the threats with which he had already</p>
<p>threatened Ulysses,</p>
<p>so he took counsel with Jove. ‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äù said</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI shall no longer be held in any sort of respect among you gods,</p>
<p>if mortals like the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>who are my own flesh and blood,</p>
<p>show</p>
<p>such small regard for me. I said I would let Ulysses get home when he</p>
<p>had suffered sufficiently. I did not say that he should never get home</p>
<p>at all,</p>
<p>for I knew you had already nodded your head about it,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>promised that he should do so; but now they have brought him in a ship</p>
<p>fast asleep and have landed him in Ithaca after loading him with more</p>
<p>magnificent presents of bronze,</p>
<p>gold,</p>
<p>and raiment than he would ever</p>
<p>have brought back from Troy,</p>
<p>if he had had his share of the spoil and</p>
<p>got home without misadventure.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Jove answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat,</p>
<p>O Lord of the Earthquake,</p>
<p>are you talking</p>
<p>about? The gods are by no means wanting in respect for you. It would be</p>
<p>monstrous were they to insult one so old and honoured as you are. As</p>
<p>regards mortals,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>if any of them is indulging in insolence and</p>
<p>treating you disrespectfully,</p>
<p>it will always rest with yourself to deal</p>
<p>with him as you may think proper,</p>
<p>so do just as you please.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI should have done so at once,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Neptune,</p>
<p>‚Äúif I were not</p>
<p>anxious to avoid anything that might displease you; now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>should like to wreck the Phaeacian ship as it is returning from its</p>
<p>escort. This will stop them from escorting people in future; and I</p>
<p>should also like to bury their city under a huge mountain.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy good friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Jove,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI should recommend you at the very</p>
<p>moment when the people from the city are watching the ship on her way,</p>
<p>to turn it into a rock near the land and looking like a ship. This will</p>
<p>astonish everybody,</p>
<p>and you can then bury their city under the</p>
<p>mountain.‚Äù</p>
<p>When earth-encircling Neptune heard this he went to Scheria where the</p>
<p>Phaeacians live,</p>
<p>and stayed there till the ship,</p>
<p>which was making rapid</p>
<p>way,</p>
<p>had got close in. Then he went up to it,</p>
<p>turned it into stone,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>drove it down with the flat of his hand so as to root it in the ground.</p>
<p>After this he went away.</p>
<p>The Phaeacians then began talking among themselves,</p>
<p>and one would turn</p>
<p>towards his neighbour,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúBless my heart,</p>
<p>who is it that can have</p>
<p>rooted the ship in the sea just as she was getting into port? We could</p>
<p>see the whole of her only a moment ago.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was how they talked,</p>
<p>but they knew nothing about it; and Alcinous</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI remember now the old prophecy of my father. He said that</p>
<p>Neptune would be angry with us for taking every one so safely over the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>and would one day wreck a Phaeacian ship as it was returning from</p>
<p>an escort,</p>
<p>and bury our city under a high mountain. This was what my</p>
<p>old father used to say,</p>
<p>and now it is all coming true.117 Now therefore</p>
<p>let us all do as I say; in the first place we must leave off giving</p>
<p>people escorts when they come here,</p>
<p>and in the next let us sacrifice</p>
<p>twelve picked bulls to Neptune that he may have mercy upon us,</p>
<p>and not</p>
<p>bury our city under the high mountain.‚Äù When the people heard this they</p>
<p>were afraid and got ready the bulls.</p>
<p>Thus did the chiefs and rulers of the Phaeacians pray to king Neptune,</p>
<p>standing round his altar; and at the same time118 Ulysses woke up once</p>
<p>more upon his own soil. He had been so long away that he did not know</p>
<p>it again; moreover,</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs daughter Minerva had made it a foggy day,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that people might not know of his having come,</p>
<p>and that she might tell</p>
<p>him everything without either his wife or his fellow citizens and</p>
<p>friends recognising him119 until he had taken his revenge upon the</p>
<p>wicked suitors. Everything,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>seemed quite different to</p>
<p>him‚Äîthe long straight tracks,</p>
<p>the harbours,</p>
<p>the precipices,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>goodly trees,</p>
<p>appeared all changed as he started up and looked upon his</p>
<p>native land. So he smote his thighs with the flat of his hands and</p>
<p>cried aloud despairingly.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlas,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúamong what manner of people am I fallen? Are</p>
<p>they savage and uncivilised or hospitable and humane? Where shall I put</p>
<p>all this treasure,</p>
<p>and which way shall I go? I wish I had staid over</p>
<p>there with the Phaeacians; or I could have gone to some other great</p>
<p>chief who would have been good to me and given me an escort. As it is I</p>
<p>do not know where to put my treasure,</p>
<p>and I cannot leave it here for</p>
<p>fear somebody else should get hold of it. In good truth the chiefs and</p>
<p>rulers of the Phaeacians have not been dealing fairly by me,</p>
<p>and have</p>
<p>left me in the wrong country; they said they would take me back to</p>
<p>Ithaca and they have not done so: may Jove the protector of suppliants</p>
<p>chastise them,</p>
<p>for he watches over everybody and punishes those who do</p>
<p>wrong. Still,</p>
<p>I suppose I must count my goods and see if the crew have</p>
<p>gone off with any of them.‚Äù</p>
<p>He counted his goodly coppers and cauldrons,</p>
<p>his gold and all his</p>
<p>clothes,</p>
<p>but there was nothing missing; still he kept grieving about</p>
<p>not being in his own country,</p>
<p>and wandered up and down by the shore of</p>
<p>the sounding sea bewailing his hard fate. Then Minerva came up to him</p>
<p>disguised as a young shepherd of delicate and princely mien,</p>
<p>with a</p>
<p>good cloak folded double about her shoulders; she had sandals on her</p>
<p>comely feet and held a javelin in her hand. Ulysses was glad when he</p>
<p>saw her,</p>
<p>and went straight up to her.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou are the first person whom I have met with in</p>
<p>this country; I salute you,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and beg you to be well disposed</p>
<p>towards me. Protect these my goods,</p>
<p>and myself too,</p>
<p>for I embrace your</p>
<p>knees and pray to you as though you were a god. Tell me,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>and tell</p>
<p>me truly,</p>
<p>what land and country is this? Who are its inhabitants? Am I</p>
<p>on an island,</p>
<p>or is this the sea board of some continent?‚Äù</p>
<p>Minerva answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>you must be very simple,</p>
<p>or must have come</p>
<p>from somewhere a long way off,</p>
<p>not to know what country this is. It is</p>
<p>a very celebrated place,</p>
<p>and everybody knows it East and West. It is</p>
<p>rugged and not a good driving country,</p>
<p>but it is by no means a bad</p>
<p>island for what there is of it. It grows any quantity of corn and also</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>for it is watered both by rain and dew; it breeds cattle also and</p>
<p>goats; all kinds of timber grow here,</p>
<p>and there are watering places</p>
<p>where the water never runs dry; so,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>the name of Ithaca is known</p>
<p>even as far as Troy,</p>
<p>which I understand to be a long way off from this</p>
<p>Achaean country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses was glad at finding himself,</p>
<p>as Minerva told him,</p>
<p>in his own</p>
<p>country,</p>
<p>and he began to answer,</p>
<p>but he did not speak the truth,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>made up a lying story in the instinctive wiliness of his heart.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI heard of Ithaca,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhen I was in Crete beyond the seas,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>now it seems I have reached it with all these treasures. I have left as</p>
<p>much more behind me for my children,</p>
<p>but am flying because I killed</p>
<p>Orsilochus son of Idomeneus,</p>
<p>the fleetest runner in Crete. I killed him</p>
<p>because he wanted to rob me of the spoils I had got from Troy with so</p>
<p>much trouble and danger both on the field of battle and by the waves of</p>
<p>the weary sea; he said I had not served his father loyally at Troy as</p>
<p>vassal,</p>
<p>but had set myself up as an independent ruler,</p>
<p>so I lay in wait</p>
<p>for him with one of my followers by the road side,</p>
<p>and speared him as</p>
<p>he was coming into town from the country. It was a very dark night and</p>
<p>nobody saw us; it was not known,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>that I had killed him,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>as soon as I had done so I went to a ship and besought the owners,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>were Phoenicians,</p>
<p>to take me on board and set me in Pylos or in Elis</p>
<p>where the Epeans rule,</p>
<p>giving them as much spoil as satisfied them.</p>
<p>They meant no guile,</p>
<p>but the wind drove them off their course,</p>
<p>and we</p>
<p>sailed on till we came hither by night. It was all we could do to get</p>
<p>inside the harbour,</p>
<p>and none of us said a word about supper though we</p>
<p>wanted it badly,</p>
<p>but we all went on shore and lay down just as we were.</p>
<p>I was very tired and fell asleep directly,</p>
<p>so they took my goods out of</p>
<p>the ship,</p>
<p>and placed them beside me where I was lying upon the sand.</p>
<p>Then they sailed away to Sidonia,</p>
<p>and I was left here in great distress</p>
<p>of mind.‚Äù</p>
<p>Such was his story,</p>
<p>but Minerva smiled and caressed him with her hand.</p>
<p>Then she took the form of a woman,</p>
<p>fair,</p>
<p>stately,</p>
<p>and wise,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe must be</p>
<p>indeed a shifty lying fellow,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúwho could surpass you in all</p>
<p>manner of craft even though you had a god for your antagonist. Dare</p>
<p>devil that you are,</p>
<p>full of guile,</p>
<p>unwearying in deceit,</p>
<p>can you not</p>
<p>drop your tricks and your instinctive falsehood,</p>
<p>even now that you are</p>
<p>in your own country again? We will say no more,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>about this,</p>
<p>for we can both of us deceive upon occasion‚Äîyou are the most</p>
<p>accomplished counsellor and orator among all mankind,</p>
<p>while I for</p>
<p>diplomacy and subtlety have no equal among the gods. Did you not know</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs daughter Minerva‚Äîme,</p>
<p>who have been ever with you,</p>
<p>who kept watch</p>
<p>over you in all your troubles,</p>
<p>and who made the Phaeacians take so</p>
<p>great a liking to you? And now,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>I am come here to talk things</p>
<p>over with you,</p>
<p>and help you to hide the treasure I made the Phaeacians</p>
<p>give you; I want to tell you about the troubles that await you in your</p>
<p>own house; you have got to face them,</p>
<p>but tell no one,</p>
<p>neither man nor</p>
<p>woman,</p>
<p>that you have come home again. Bear everything,</p>
<p>and put up with</p>
<p>every man‚Äôs insolence,</p>
<p>without a word.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúA man,</p>
<p>goddess,</p>
<p>may know a great deal,</p>
<p>but you</p>
<p>are so constantly changing your appearance that when he meets you it is</p>
<p>a hard matter for him to know whether it is you or not. This much,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I know exceedingly well; you were very kind to me as long as</p>
<p>we Achaeans were fighting before Troy,</p>
<p>but from the day on which we</p>
<p>went on board ship after having sacked the city of Priam,</p>
<p>and heaven</p>
<p>dispersed us‚Äîfrom that day,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>I saw no more of you,</p>
<p>and cannot</p>
<p>ever remember your coming to my ship to help me in a difficulty; I had</p>
<p>to wander on sick and sorry till the gods delivered me from evil and I</p>
<p>reached the city of the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>where you encouraged me and took me</p>
<p>into the town.120 And now,</p>
<p>I beseech you in your father‚Äôs name,</p>
<p>tell me</p>
<p>the truth,</p>
<p>for I do not believe I am really back in Ithaca. I am in</p>
<p>some other country and you are mocking me and deceiving me in all you</p>
<p>have been saying. Tell me then truly,</p>
<p>have I really got back to my own</p>
<p>country?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are always taking something of that sort in your head,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúand that is why I cannot desert you in your afflictions; you</p>
<p>are so plausible,</p>
<p>shrewd and shifty. Any one but yourself on returning</p>
<p>from so long a voyage would at once have gone home to see his wife and</p>
<p>children,</p>
<p>but you do not seem to care about asking after them or</p>
<p>hearing any news about them till you have exploited your wife,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>remains at home vainly grieving for you,</p>
<p>and having no peace night or</p>
<p>day for the tears she sheds on your behalf. As for my not coming near</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>I was never uneasy about you,</p>
<p>for I was certain you would get back</p>
<p>safely though you would lose all your men,</p>
<p>and I did not wish to</p>
<p>quarrel with my uncle Neptune,</p>
<p>who never forgave you for having blinded</p>
<p>his son.121 I will now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>point out to you the lie of the land,</p>
<p>and you will then perhaps believe me. This is the haven of the old</p>
<p>merman Phorcys,</p>
<p>and here is the olive tree that grows at the head of</p>
<p>it; [near it is the cave sacred to the Naiads;122 here too is the</p>
<p>overarching cavern in which you have offered many an acceptable</p>
<p>hecatomb to the nymphs,</p>
<p>and this is the wooded mountain Neritum.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke the goddess dispersed the mist and the land appeared. Then</p>
<p>Ulysses rejoiced at finding himself again in his own land,</p>
<p>and kissed</p>
<p>the bounteous soil; he lifted up his hands and prayed to the nymphs,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNaiad nymphs,</p>
<p>daughters of Jove,</p>
<p>I made sure that I was never</p>
<p>again to see you,</p>
<p>now therefore I greet you with all loving</p>
<p>salutations,</p>
<p>and I will bring you offerings as in the old days,</p>
<p>if</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs redoubtable daughter will grant me life,</p>
<p>and bring my son to</p>
<p>manhood.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake heart,</p>
<p>and do not trouble yourself about that,</p>
<p>‚Äù rejoined Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúlet us rather set about stowing your things at once in the cave,</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>they will be quite safe. Let us see how we can best manage it all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Therewith she went down into the cave to look for the safest hiding</p>
<p>places,</p>
<p>while Ulysses brought up all the treasure of gold,</p>
<p>bronze,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>good clothing which the Phaeacians had given him. They stowed</p>
<p>everything carefully away,</p>
<p>and Minerva set a stone against the door of</p>
<p>the cave. Then the two sat down by the root of the great olive,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>consulted how to compass the destruction of the wicked suitors.</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúnoble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>think how you can lay</p>
<p>hands on these disreputable people who have been lording it in your</p>
<p>house these three years,</p>
<p>courting your wife and making wedding presents</p>
<p>to her,</p>
<p>while she does nothing but lament your absence,</p>
<p>giving hope and</p>
<p>sending encouraging messages123 to every one of them,</p>
<p>but meaning the</p>
<p>very opposite of all she says.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn good truth,</p>
<p>goddess,</p>
<p>it seems I should have</p>
<p>come to much the same bad end in my own house as Agamemnon did,</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>had not given me such timely information. Advise me how I shall best</p>
<p>avenge myself. Stand by my side and put your courage into my heart as</p>
<p>on the day when we loosed Troy‚Äôs fair diadem from her brow. Help me now</p>
<p>as you did then,</p>
<p>and I will fight three hundred men,</p>
<p>if you,</p>
<p>goddess,</p>
<p>will be with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúTrust me for that,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will not lose sight of you when once</p>
<p>we set about it,</p>
<p>and I imagine that some of those who are devouring</p>
<p>your substance will then bespatter the pavement with their blood and</p>
<p>brains. I will begin by disguising you so that no human being shall</p>
<p>know you; I will cover your body with wrinkles; you shall lose all your</p>
<p>yellow hair; I will clothe you in a garment that shall fill all who see</p>
<p>it with loathing; I will blear your fine eyes for you,</p>
<p>and make you an</p>
<p>unseemly object in the sight of the suitors,</p>
<p>of your wife,</p>
<p>and of the</p>
<p>son whom you left behind you. Then go at once to the swineherd who is</p>
<p>in charge of your pigs; he has been always well affected towards you,</p>
<p>and is devoted to Penelope and your son; you will find him feeding his</p>
<p>pigs near the rock that is called Raven124 by the fountain Arethusa,</p>
<p>where they are fattening on beechmast and spring water after their</p>
<p>manner. Stay with him and find out how things are going,</p>
<p>while I</p>
<p>proceed to Sparta and see your son,</p>
<p>who is with Menelaus at Lacedaemon,</p>
<p>where he has gone to try and find out whether you are still alive.‚Äù125</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut why,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúdid you not tell him,</p>
<p>for you knew all about</p>
<p>it? Did you want him too to go sailing about amid all kinds of hardship</p>
<p>while others are eating up his estate?‚Äù</p>
<p>Minerva answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNever mind about him,</p>
<p>I sent him that he might be</p>
<p>well spoken of for having gone. He is in no sort of difficulty,</p>
<p>but is</p>
<p>staying quite comfortably with Menelaus,</p>
<p>and is surrounded with</p>
<p>abundance of every kind. The suitors have put out to sea and are lying</p>
<p>in wait for him,</p>
<p>for they mean to kill him before he can get home. I do</p>
<p>not much think they will succeed,</p>
<p>but rather that some of those who are</p>
<p>now eating up your estate will first find a grave themselves.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke Minerva touched him with her wand and covered him with</p>
<p>wrinkles,</p>
<p>took away all his yellow hair,</p>
<p>and withered the flesh over</p>
<p>his whole body; she bleared his eyes,</p>
<p>which were naturally very fine</p>
<p>ones; she changed his clothes and threw an old rag of a wrap about him,</p>
<p>and a tunic,</p>
<p>tattered,</p>
<p>filthy,</p>
<p>and begrimed with smoke; she also gave</p>
<p>him an undressed deer skin as an outer garment,</p>
<p>and furnished him with</p>
<p>a staff and a wallet all in holes,</p>
<p>with a twisted thong for him to</p>
<p>sling it over his shoulder.</p>
<p>When the pair had thus laid their plans they parted,</p>
<p>and the goddess</p>
<p>went straight to Lacedaemon to fetch Telemachus.</p>

<p>ULYSSES IN THE HUT WITH EUMAEUS.</p>
<p>Ulysses now left the haven,</p>
<p>and took the rough track up through the</p>
<p>wooded country and over the crest of the mountain till he reached the</p>
<p>place where Minerva had said that he would find the swineherd,</p>
<p>who was</p>
<p>the most thrifty servant he had. He found him sitting in front of his</p>
<p>hut,</p>
<p>which was by the yards that he had built on a site which could be</p>
<p>seen from far. He had made them spacious126 and fair to see,</p>
<p>with a</p>
<p>free run for the pigs all round them; he had built them during his</p>
<p>master‚Äôs absence,</p>
<p>of stones which he had gathered out of the ground,</p>
<p>without saying anything to Penelope or Laertes,</p>
<p>and he had fenced them</p>
<p>on top with thorn bushes. Outside the yard he had run a strong fence of</p>
<p>oaken posts,</p>
<p>split,</p>
<p>and set pretty close together,</p>
<p>while inside he had</p>
<p>built twelve styes near one another for the sows to lie in. There were</p>
<p>fifty pigs wallowing in each stye,</p>
<p>all of them breeding sows; but the</p>
<p>boars slept outside and were much fewer in number,</p>
<p>for the suitors kept</p>
<p>on eating them,</p>
<p>and the swineherd had to send them the best he had</p>
<p>continually. There were three hundred and sixty boar pigs,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>herdsman‚Äôs four hounds,</p>
<p>which were as fierce as wolves,</p>
<p>slept always</p>
<p>with them. The swineherd was at that moment cutting out a pair of</p>
<p>sandals127 from a good stout ox hide. Three of his men were out herding</p>
<p>the pigs in one place or another,</p>
<p>and he had sent the fourth to town</p>
<p>with a boar that he had been forced to send the suitors that they might</p>
<p>sacrifice it and have their fill of meat.</p>
<p>When the hounds saw Ulysses they set up a furious barking and flew at</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>but Ulysses was cunning enough to sit down and loose his hold of</p>
<p>the stick that he had in his hand: still,</p>
<p>he would have been torn by</p>
<p>them in his own homestead had not the swineherd dropped his ox hide,</p>
<p>rushed full speed through the gate of the yard and driven the dogs off</p>
<p>by shouting and throwing stones at them. Then he said to Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld</p>
<p>man,</p>
<p>the dogs were likely to have made short work of you,</p>
<p>and then you</p>
<p>would have got me into trouble. The gods have given me quite enough</p>
<p>worries without that,</p>
<p>for I have lost the best of masters,</p>
<p>and am in</p>
<p>continual grief on his account. I have to attend swine for other people</p>
<p>to eat,</p>
<p>while he,</p>
<p>if he yet lives to see the light of day,</p>
<p>is starving</p>
<p>in some distant land. But come inside,</p>
<p>and when you have had your fill</p>
<p>of bread and wine,</p>
<p>tell me where you come from,</p>
<p>and all about your</p>
<p>misfortunes.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the swineherd led the way into the hut and bade him sit down.</p>
<p>He strewed a good thick bed of rushes upon the floor,</p>
<p>and on the top of</p>
<p>this he threw the shaggy chamois skin‚Äîa great thick one‚Äîon which he</p>
<p>used to sleep by night. Ulysses was pleased at being made thus welcome,</p>
<p>and said ‚ÄúMay Jove,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>and the rest of the gods grant you your</p>
<p>heart‚Äôs desire in return for the kind way in which you have received</p>
<p>me.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>though a still</p>
<p>poorer man should come here,</p>
<p>it would not be right for me to insult</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>for all strangers and beggars are from Jove. You must take what</p>
<p>you can get and be thankful,</p>
<p>for servants live in fear when they have</p>
<p>young lords for their masters; and this is my misfortune now,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>heaven has hindered the return of him who would have been always good</p>
<p>to me and given me something of my own‚Äîa house,</p>
<p>a piece of land,</p>
<p>a good</p>
<p>looking wife,</p>
<p>and all else that a liberal master allows a servant who</p>
<p>has worked hard for him,</p>
<p>and whose labour the gods have prospered as</p>
<p>they have mine in the situation which I hold. If my master had grown</p>
<p>old here he would have done great things by me,</p>
<p>but he is gone,</p>
<p>and I</p>
<p>wish that Helen‚Äôs whole race were utterly destroyed,</p>
<p>for she has been</p>
<p>the death of many a good man. It was this matter that took my master to</p>
<p>Ilius,</p>
<p>the land of noble steeds,</p>
<p>to fight the Trojans in the cause of</p>
<p>king Agamemnon.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he bound his girdle round him and went to the styes where</p>
<p>the young sucking pigs were penned. He picked out two which he brought</p>
<p>back with him and sacrificed. He singed them,</p>
<p>cut them up,</p>
<p>and spitted</p>
<p>them; when the meat was cooked he brought it all in and set it before</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>hot and still on the spit,</p>
<p>whereon Ulysses sprinkled it over</p>
<p>with white barley meal. The swineherd then mixed wine in a bowl of</p>
<p>ivy-wood,</p>
<p>and taking a seat opposite Ulysses told him to begin.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFall to,</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúon a dish of servant‚Äôs pork. The fat</p>
<p>pigs have to go to the suitors,</p>
<p>who eat them up without shame or</p>
<p>scruple; but the blessed gods love not such shameful doings,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>respect those who do what is lawful and right. Even the fierce</p>
<p>freebooters who go raiding on other people‚Äôs land,</p>
<p>and Jove gives them</p>
<p>their spoil‚Äîeven they,</p>
<p>when they have filled their ships and got home</p>
<p>again live conscience-stricken,</p>
<p>and look fearfully for judgement; but</p>
<p>some god seems to have told these people that Ulysses is dead and gone;</p>
<p>they will not,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>go back to their own homes and make their</p>
<p>offers of marriage in the usual way,</p>
<p>but waste his estate by force,</p>
<p>without fear or stint. Not a day or night comes out of heaven,</p>
<p>but they</p>
<p>sacrifice not one victim nor two only,</p>
<p>and they take the run of his</p>
<p>wine,</p>
<p>for he was exceedingly rich. No other great man either in Ithaca</p>
<p>or on the mainland is as rich as he was; he had as much as twenty men</p>
<p>put together. I will tell you what he had. There are twelve herds of</p>
<p>cattle upon the main land,</p>
<p>and as many flocks of sheep,</p>
<p>there are also</p>
<p>twelve droves of pigs,</p>
<p>while his own men and hired strangers feed him</p>
<p>twelve widely spreading herds of goats. Here in Ithaca he runs even</p>
<p>large flocks of goats on the far end of the island,</p>
<p>and they are in the</p>
<p>charge of excellent goat herds. Each one of these sends the suitors the</p>
<p>best goat in the flock every day. As for myself,</p>
<p>I am in charge of the</p>
<p>pigs that you see here,</p>
<p>and I have to keep picking out the best I have</p>
<p>and sending it to them.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was his story,</p>
<p>but Ulysses went on eating and drinking ravenously</p>
<p>without a word,</p>
<p>brooding his revenge. When he had eaten enough and was</p>
<p>satisfied,</p>
<p>the swineherd took the bowl from which he usually drank,</p>
<p>filled it with wine,</p>
<p>and gave it to Ulysses,</p>
<p>who was pleased,</p>
<p>and said</p>
<p>as he took it in his hands,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>who was this master of yours</p>
<p>that bought you and paid for you,</p>
<p>so rich and so powerful as you tell</p>
<p>me? You say he perished in the cause of King Agamemnon; tell me who he</p>
<p>was,</p>
<p>in case I may have met with such a person. Jove and the other gods</p>
<p>know,</p>
<p>but I may be able to give you news of him,</p>
<p>for I have travelled</p>
<p>much.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eumaeus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld man,</p>
<p>no traveller who comes here with news will</p>
<p>get Ulysses‚Äô wife and son to believe his story. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>tramps in</p>
<p>want of a lodging keep coming with their mouths full of lies,</p>
<p>and not a</p>
<p>word of truth; every one who finds his way to Ithaca goes to my</p>
<p>mistress and tells her falsehoods,</p>
<p>whereon she takes them in,</p>
<p>makes</p>
<p>much of them,</p>
<p>and asks them all manner of questions,</p>
<p>crying all the</p>
<p>time as women will when they have lost their husbands. And you too,</p>
<p>old</p>
<p>man,</p>
<p>for a shirt and a cloak would doubtless make up a very pretty</p>
<p>story. But the wolves and birds of prey have long since torn Ulysses to</p>
<p>pieces,</p>
<p>or the fishes of the sea have eaten him,</p>
<p>and his bones are</p>
<p>lying buried deep in sand upon some foreign shore; he is dead and gone,</p>
<p>and a bad business it is for all his friends‚Äîfor me especially; go</p>
<p>where I may I shall never find so good a master,</p>
<p>not even if I were to</p>
<p>go home to my mother and father where I was bred and born. I do not so</p>
<p>much care,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>about my parents now,</p>
<p>though I should dearly like</p>
<p>to see them again in my own country; it is the loss of Ulysses that</p>
<p>grieves me most; I cannot speak of him without reverence though he is</p>
<p>here no longer,</p>
<p>for he was very fond of me,</p>
<p>and took such care of me</p>
<p>that wherever he may be I shall always honour his memory.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou are very positive,</p>
<p>and very hard of</p>
<p>belief about your master‚Äôs coming home again,</p>
<p>nevertheless I will not</p>
<p>merely say,</p>
<p>but will swear,</p>
<p>that he is coming. Do not give me anything</p>
<p>for my news till he has actually come,</p>
<p>you may then give me a shirt and</p>
<p>cloak of good wear if you will. I am in great want,</p>
<p>but I will not take</p>
<p>anything at all till then,</p>
<p>for I hate a man,</p>
<p>even as I hate hell fire,</p>
<p>who lets his poverty tempt him into lying. I swear by king Jove,</p>
<p>by the</p>
<p>rites of hospitality,</p>
<p>and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I have now</p>
<p>come,</p>
<p>that all will surely happen as I have said it will. Ulysses will</p>
<p>return in this self same year; with the end of this moon and the</p>
<p>beginning of the next he will be here to do vengeance on all those who</p>
<p>are ill treating his wife and son.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld man,</p>
<p>you will neither</p>
<p>get paid for bringing good news,</p>
<p>nor will Ulysses ever come home; drink</p>
<p>your wine in peace,</p>
<p>and let us talk about something else. Do not keep</p>
<p>on reminding me of all this; it always pains me when any one speaks</p>
<p>about my honoured master. As for your oath we will let it alone,</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>only wish he may come,</p>
<p>as do Penelope,</p>
<p>his old father Laertes,</p>
<p>and his</p>
<p>son Telemachus. I am terribly unhappy too about this same boy of his;</p>
<p>he was running up fast into manhood,</p>
<p>and bade fare to be no worse man,</p>
<p>face and figure,</p>
<p>than his father,</p>
<p>but some one,</p>
<p>either god or man,</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>been unsettling his mind,</p>
<p>so he has gone off to Pylos to try and get</p>
<p>news of his father,</p>
<p>and the suitors are lying in wait for him as he is</p>
<p>coming home,</p>
<p>in the hope of leaving the house of Arceisius without a</p>
<p>name in Ithaca. But let us say no more about him,</p>
<p>and leave him to be</p>
<p>taken,</p>
<p>or else to escape if the son of Saturn holds his hand over him</p>
<p>to protect him. And now,</p>
<p>old man,</p>
<p>tell me your own story; tell me also,</p>
<p>for I want to know,</p>
<p>who you are and where you come from. Tell me of</p>
<p>your town and parents,</p>
<p>what manner of ship you came in,</p>
<p>how crew</p>
<p>brought you to Ithaca,</p>
<p>and from what country they professed to come‚Äîfor</p>
<p>you cannot have come by land.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you all about it. If there were meat</p>
<p>and wine enough,</p>
<p>and we could stay here in the hut with nothing to do</p>
<p>but to eat and drink while the others go to their work,</p>
<p>I could easily</p>
<p>talk on for a whole twelve months without ever finishing the story of</p>
<p>the sorrows with which it has pleased heaven to visit me.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am by birth a Cretan; my father was a well to do man,</p>
<p>who had many</p>
<p>sons born in marriage,</p>
<p>whereas I was the son of a slave whom he had</p>
<p>purchased for a concubine; nevertheless,</p>
<p>my father Castor son of Hylax</p>
<p>(whose lineage I claim,</p>
<p>and who was held in the highest honour among</p>
<p>the Cretans for his wealth,</p>
<p>prosperity,</p>
<p>and the valour of his sons) put</p>
<p>me on the same level with my brothers who had been born in wedlock.</p>
<p>When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>death took him to the house of Hades,</p>
<p>his sons divided</p>
<p>his estate and cast lots for their shares,</p>
<p>but to me they gave a</p>
<p>holding and little else; nevertheless,</p>
<p>my valour enabled me to marry</p>
<p>into a rich family,</p>
<p>for I was not given to bragging,</p>
<p>or shirking on the</p>
<p>field of battle. It is all over now; still,</p>
<p>if you look at the straw</p>
<p>you can see what the ear was,</p>
<p>for I have had trouble enough and to</p>
<p>spare. Mars and Minerva made me doughty in war; when I had picked my</p>
<p>men to surprise the enemy with an ambuscade I never gave death so much</p>
<p>as a thought,</p>
<p>but was the first to leap forward and spear all whom I</p>
<p>could overtake. Such was I in battle,</p>
<p>but I did not care about farm</p>
<p>work,</p>
<p>nor the frugal home life of those who would bring up children. My</p>
<p>delight was in ships,</p>
<p>fighting,</p>
<p>javelins,</p>
<p>and arrows‚Äîthings that most</p>
<p>men shudder to think of; but one man likes one thing and another</p>
<p>another,</p>
<p>and this was what I was most naturally inclined to. Before the</p>
<p>Achaeans went to Troy,</p>
<p>nine times was I in command of men and ships on</p>
<p>foreign service,</p>
<p>and I amassed much wealth. I had my pick of the spoil</p>
<p>in the first instance,</p>
<p>and much more was allotted to me later on.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy house grew apace and I became a great man among the Cretans,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>when Jove counselled that terrible expedition,</p>
<p>in which so many</p>
<p>perished,</p>
<p>the people required me and Idomeneus to lead their ships to</p>
<p>Troy,</p>
<p>and there was no way out of it,</p>
<p>for they insisted on our doing</p>
<p>so. There we fought for nine whole years,</p>
<p>but in the tenth we sacked</p>
<p>the city of Priam and sailed home again as heaven dispersed us. Then it</p>
<p>was that Jove devised evil against me. I spent but one month happily</p>
<p>with my children,</p>
<p>wife,</p>
<p>and property,</p>
<p>and then I conceived the idea of</p>
<p>making a descent on Egypt,</p>
<p>so I fitted out a fine fleet and manned it.</p>
<p>I had nine ships,</p>
<p>and the people flocked to fill them. For six days I</p>
<p>and my men made feast,</p>
<p>and I found them many victims both for sacrifice</p>
<p>to the gods and for themselves,</p>
<p>but on the seventh day we went on board</p>
<p>and set sail from Crete with a fair North wind behind us though we were</p>
<p>going down a river. Nothing went ill with any of our ships,</p>
<p>and we had</p>
<p>no sickness on board,</p>
<p>but sat where we were and let the ships go as the</p>
<p>wind and steersmen took them. On the fifth day we reached the river</p>
<p>Aegyptus; there I stationed my ships in the river,</p>
<p>bidding my men stay</p>
<p>by them and keep guard over them while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre</p>
<p>from every point of vantage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the men disobeyed my orders,</p>
<p>took to their own devices,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ravaged the land of the Egyptians,</p>
<p>killing the men,</p>
<p>and taking their</p>
<p>wives and children captive. The alarm was soon carried to the city,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>when they heard the war cry,</p>
<p>the people came out at daybreak till the</p>
<p>plain was filled with horsemen and foot soldiers and with the gleam of</p>
<p>armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men,</p>
<p>and they would no longer</p>
<p>face the enemy,</p>
<p>for they found themselves surrounded. The Egyptians</p>
<p>killed many of us,</p>
<p>and took the rest alive to do forced labour for</p>
<p>them. Jove,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>put it in my mind to do thus‚Äîand I wish I had died</p>
<p>then and there in Egypt instead,</p>
<p>for there was much sorrow in store for</p>
<p>me‚ÄîI took off my helmet and shield and dropped my spear from my hand;</p>
<p>then I went straight up to the king‚Äôs chariot,</p>
<p>clasped his knees and</p>
<p>kissed them,</p>
<p>whereon he spared my life,</p>
<p>bade me get into his chariot,</p>
<p>and took me weeping to his own home. Many made at me with their ashen</p>
<p>spears and tried to kill me in their fury,</p>
<p>but the king protected me,</p>
<p>for he feared the wrath of Jove the protector of strangers,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>punishes those who do evil.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI stayed there for seven years and got together much money among the</p>
<p>Egyptians,</p>
<p>for they all gave me something; but when it was now going on</p>
<p>for eight years there came a certain Phoenician,</p>
<p>a cunning rascal,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>had already committed all sorts of villainy,</p>
<p>and this man talked me</p>
<p>over into going with him to Phoenicia,</p>
<p>where his house and his</p>
<p>possessions lay. I stayed there for a whole twelve months,</p>
<p>but at the</p>
<p>end of that time when months and days had gone by till the same season</p>
<p>had come round again,</p>
<p>he set me on board a ship bound for Libya,</p>
<p>on a</p>
<p>pretence that I was to take a cargo along with him to that place,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>really that he might sell me as a slave and take the money I fetched. I</p>
<p>suspected his intention,</p>
<p>but went on board with him,</p>
<p>for I could not</p>
<p>help it.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe ship ran before a fresh North wind till we had reached the sea</p>
<p>that lies between Crete and Libya; there,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>Jove counselled</p>
<p>their destruction,</p>
<p>for as soon as we were well out from Crete and could</p>
<p>see nothing but sea and sky,</p>
<p>he raised a black cloud over our ship and</p>
<p>the sea grew dark beneath it. Then Jove let fly with his thunderbolts</p>
<p>and the ship went round and round and was filled with fire and</p>
<p>brimstone as the lightning struck it. The men fell all into the sea;</p>
<p>they were carried about in the water round the ship looking like so</p>
<p>many sea-gulls,</p>
<p>but the god presently deprived them of all chance of</p>
<p>getting home again. I was all dismayed. Jove,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>sent the ship‚Äôs</p>
<p>mast within my reach,</p>
<p>which saved my life,</p>
<p>for I clung to it,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>drifted before the fury of the gale. Nine days did I drift but in the</p>
<p>darkness of the tenth night a great wave bore me on to the Thesprotian</p>
<p>coast. There Pheidon king of the Thesprotians entertained me hospitably</p>
<p>without charging me anything at all‚Äîfor his son found me when I was</p>
<p>nearly dead with cold and fatigue,</p>
<p>whereon he raised me by the hand,</p>
<p>took me to his father‚Äôs house and gave me clothes to wear.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere it was that I heard news of Ulysses,</p>
<p>for the king told me he had</p>
<p>entertained him,</p>
<p>and shown him much hospitality while he was on his</p>
<p>homeward journey. He showed me also the treasure of gold,</p>
<p>and wrought</p>
<p>iron that Ulysses had got together. There was enough to keep his family</p>
<p>for ten generations,</p>
<p>so much had he left in the house of king Pheidon.</p>
<p>But the king said Ulysses had gone to Dodona that he might learn Jove‚Äôs</p>
<p>mind from the god‚Äôs high oak tree,</p>
<p>and know whether after so long an</p>
<p>absence he should return to Ithaca openly,</p>
<p>or in secret. Moreover the</p>
<p>king swore in my presence,</p>
<p>making drink-offerings in his own house as</p>
<p>he did so,</p>
<p>that the ship was by the water side,</p>
<p>and the crew found,</p>
<p>that should take him to his own country. He sent me off however before</p>
<p>Ulysses returned,</p>
<p>for there happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing</p>
<p>for the wheat-growing island of Dulichium,</p>
<p>and he told those in charge</p>
<p>of her to be sure and take me safely to King Acastus.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese men hatched a plot against me that would have reduced me to the</p>
<p>very extreme of misery,</p>
<p>for when the ship had got some way out from</p>
<p>land they resolved on selling me as a slave. They stripped me of the</p>
<p>shirt and cloak that I was wearing,</p>
<p>and gave me instead the tattered</p>
<p>old clouts in which you now see me; then,</p>
<p>towards nightfall,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>reached the tilled lands of Ithaca,</p>
<p>and there they bound me with a</p>
<p>strong rope fast in the ship,</p>
<p>while they went on shore to get supper by</p>
<p>the sea side. But the gods soon undid my bonds for me,</p>
<p>and having drawn</p>
<p>my rags over my head I slid down the rudder into the sea,</p>
<p>where I</p>
<p>struck out and swam till I was well clear of them,</p>
<p>and came ashore near</p>
<p>a thick wood in which I lay concealed. They were very angry at my</p>
<p>having escaped and went searching about for me,</p>
<p>till at last they</p>
<p>thought it was no further use and went back to their ship. The gods,</p>
<p>having hidden me thus easily,</p>
<p>then took me to a good man‚Äôs door‚Äîfor it</p>
<p>seems that I am not to die yet awhile.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúPoor unhappy stranger,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>have found the story of your misfortunes extremely interesting,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>that part about Ulysses is not right; and you will never get me to</p>
<p>believe it. Why should a man like you go about telling lies in this</p>
<p>way? I know all about the return of my master. The gods one and all of</p>
<p>them detest him,</p>
<p>or they would have taken him before Troy,</p>
<p>or let him</p>
<p>die with friends around him when the days of his fighting were done;</p>
<p>for then the Achaeans would have built a mound over his ashes and his</p>
<p>son would have been heir to his renown,</p>
<p>but now the storm winds have</p>
<p>spirited him away we know not whither.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs for me I live out of the way here with the pigs,</p>
<p>and never go to</p>
<p>the town unless when Penelope sends for me on the arrival of some news</p>
<p>about Ulysses. Then they all sit round and ask questions,</p>
<p>both those</p>
<p>who grieve over the king‚Äôs absence,</p>
<p>and those who rejoice at it because</p>
<p>they can eat up his property without paying for it. For my own part I</p>
<p>have never cared about asking anyone else since the time when I was</p>
<p>taken in by an Aetolian,</p>
<p>who had killed a man and come a long way till</p>
<p>at last he reached my station,</p>
<p>and I was very kind to him. He said he</p>
<p>had seen Ulysses with Idomeneus among the Cretans,</p>
<p>refitting his ships</p>
<p>which had been damaged in a gale. He said Ulysses would return in the</p>
<p>following summer or autumn with his men,</p>
<p>and that he would bring back</p>
<p>much wealth. And now you,</p>
<p>you unfortunate old man,</p>
<p>since fate has</p>
<p>brought you to my door,</p>
<p>do not try to flatter me in this way with vain</p>
<p>hopes. It is not for any such reason that I shall treat you kindly,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>only out of respect for Jove the god of hospitality,</p>
<p>as fearing him and</p>
<p>pitying you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see that you are of an unbelieving mind; I have</p>
<p>given you my oath,</p>
<p>and yet you will not credit me; let us then make a</p>
<p>bargain,</p>
<p>and call all the gods in heaven to witness it. If your master</p>
<p>comes home,</p>
<p>give me a cloak and shirt of good wear,</p>
<p>and send me to</p>
<p>Dulichium where I want to go; but if he does not come as I say he will,</p>
<p>set your men on to me,</p>
<p>and tell them to throw me from yonder precipice,</p>
<p>as a warning to tramps not to go about the country telling lies.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd a pretty figure I should cut then,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äúboth now and</p>
<p>hereafter,</p>
<p>if I were to kill you after receiving you into my hut and</p>
<p>showing you hospitality. I should have to say my prayers in good</p>
<p>earnest if I did; but it is just supper time and I hope my men will</p>
<p>come in directly,</p>
<p>that we may cook something savoury for supper.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse,</p>
<p>and presently the swineherds came up with the</p>
<p>pigs,</p>
<p>which were then shut up for the night in their styes,</p>
<p>and a</p>
<p>tremendous squealing they made as they were being driven into them. But</p>
<p>Eumaeus called to his men and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúBring in the best pig you have,</p>
<p>that I may sacrifice him for this stranger,</p>
<p>and we will take toll of</p>
<p>him ourselves. We have had trouble enough this long time feeding pigs,</p>
<p>while others reap the fruit of our labour.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he began chopping firewood,</p>
<p>while the others brought in a fine</p>
<p>fat five year old boar pig,</p>
<p>and set it at the altar. Eumaeus did not</p>
<p>forget the gods,</p>
<p>for he was a man of good principles,</p>
<p>so the first</p>
<p>thing he did was to cut bristles from the pig‚Äôs face and throw them</p>
<p>into the fire,</p>
<p>praying to all the gods as he did so that Ulysses might</p>
<p>return home again. Then he clubbed the pig with a billet of oak which</p>
<p>he had kept back when he was chopping the firewood,</p>
<p>and stunned it,</p>
<p>while the others slaughtered and singed it. Then they cut it up,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Eumaeus began by putting raw pieces from each joint on to some of the</p>
<p>fat; these he sprinkled with barley meal,</p>
<p>and laid upon the embers;</p>
<p>they cut the rest of the meat up small,</p>
<p>put the pieces upon the spits</p>
<p>and roasted them till they were done; when they had taken them off the</p>
<p>spits they threw them on to the dresser in a heap. The swineherd,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>was a most equitable man,</p>
<p>then stood up to give every one his share. He</p>
<p>made seven portions; one of these he set apart for Mercury the son of</p>
<p>Maia and the nymphs,</p>
<p>praying to them as he did so; the others he dealt</p>
<p>out to the men man by man. He gave Ulysses some slices cut lengthways</p>
<p>down the loin as a mark of especial honour,</p>
<p>and Ulysses was much</p>
<p>pleased. ‚ÄúI hope,</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat Jove will be as well</p>
<p>disposed towards you as I am,</p>
<p>for the respect you are showing to an</p>
<p>outcast like myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEat,</p>
<p>my good fellow,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>enjoy your supper,</p>
<p>such as it is. God grants this,</p>
<p>and withholds that,</p>
<p>just as he thinks right,</p>
<p>for he can do whatever he chooses.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he cut off the first piece and offered it as a burnt</p>
<p>sacrifice to the immortal gods; then he made them a drink-offering,</p>
<p>put</p>
<p>the cup in the hands of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and sat down to his own portion.</p>
<p>Mesaulius brought them their bread; the swineherd had brought this man</p>
<p>on his own account from among the Taphians during his master‚Äôs absence,</p>
<p>and had paid for him with his own money without saying anything either</p>
<p>to his mistress or Laertes. They then laid their hands upon the good</p>
<p>things that were before them,</p>
<p>and when they had had enough to eat and</p>
<p>drink,</p>
<p>Mesaulius took away what was left of the bread,</p>
<p>and they all</p>
<p>went to bed after having made a hearty supper.</p>
<p>Now the night came on stormy and very dark,</p>
<p>for there was no moon. It</p>
<p>poured without ceasing,</p>
<p>and the wind blew strong from the West,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>is a wet quarter,</p>
<p>so Ulysses thought he would see whether Eumaeus,</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>the excellent care he took of him,</p>
<p>would take off his own cloak and</p>
<p>give it him,</p>
<p>or make one of his men give him one. ‚ÄúListen to me,</p>
<p>‚Äù said</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus and the rest of you; when I have said a prayer I will tell</p>
<p>you something. It is the wine that makes me talk in this way; wine will</p>
<p>make even a wise man fall to singing; it will make him chuckle and</p>
<p>dance and say many a word that he had better leave unspoken; still,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>I have begun,</p>
<p>I will go on. Would that I were still young and strong as</p>
<p>when we got up an ambuscade before Troy. Menelaus and Ulysses were the</p>
<p>leaders,</p>
<p>but I was in command also,</p>
<p>for the other two would have it so.</p>
<p>When we had come up to the wall of the city we crouched down beneath</p>
<p>our armour and lay there under cover of the reeds and thick brushwood</p>
<p>that grew about the swamp. It came on to freeze with a North wind</p>
<p>blowing; the snow fell small and fine like hoar frost,</p>
<p>and our shields</p>
<p>were coated thick with rime. The others had all got cloaks and shirts,</p>
<p>and slept comfortably enough with their shields about their shoulders,</p>
<p>but I had carelessly left my cloak behind me,</p>
<p>not thinking that I</p>
<p>should be too cold,</p>
<p>and had gone off in nothing but my shirt and</p>
<p>shield. When the night was two-thirds through and the stars had shifted</p>
<p>their places,</p>
<p>I nudged Ulysses who was close to me with my elbow,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he at once gave me his ear.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äô said I,</p>
<p>‚Äòthis cold will be the death of me,</p>
<p>for I have no</p>
<p>cloak; some god fooled me into setting off with nothing on but my</p>
<p>shirt,</p>
<p>and I do not know what to do.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>who was as crafty as he was valiant,</p>
<p>hit upon the following</p>
<p>plan:</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòKeep still,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he in a low voice,</p>
<p>‚Äòor the others will hear you.‚Äô</p>
<p>Then he raised his head on his elbow.</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äô said he,</p>
<p>‚ÄòI have had a dream from heaven in my sleep. We</p>
<p>are a long way from the ships; I wish some one would go down and tell</p>
<p>Agamemnon to send us up more men at once.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this Thoas son of Andraemon threw off his cloak and set out running</p>
<p>to the ships,</p>
<p>whereon I took the cloak and lay in it comfortably enough</p>
<p>till morning. Would that I were still young and strong as I was in</p>
<p>those days,</p>
<p>for then some one of you swineherds would give me a cloak</p>
<p>both out of good will and for the respect due to a brave soldier; but</p>
<p>now people look down upon me because my clothes are shabby.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Eumaeus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld man,</p>
<p>you have told us an excellent story,</p>
<p>and have said nothing so far but what is quite satisfactory; for the</p>
<p>present,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>you shall want neither clothing nor anything else</p>
<p>that a stranger in distress may reasonably expect,</p>
<p>but to-morrow</p>
<p>morning you have to shake your own old rags about your body again,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>we have not many spare cloaks nor shirts up here,</p>
<p>but every man has</p>
<p>only one. When Ulysses‚Äô son comes home again he will give you both</p>
<p>cloak and shirt,</p>
<p>and send you wherever you may want to go.‚Äù</p>
<p>With this he got up and made a bed for Ulysses by throwing some</p>
<p>goatskins and sheepskins on the ground in front of the fire. Here</p>
<p>Ulysses lay down,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus covered him over with a great heavy cloak</p>
<p>that he kept for a change in case of extraordinarily bad weather.</p>
<p>Thus did Ulysses sleep,</p>
<p>and the young men slept beside him. But the</p>
<p>swineherd did not like sleeping away from his pigs,</p>
<p>so he got ready to</p>
<p>go outside,</p>
<p>and Ulysses was glad to see that he looked after his</p>
<p>property during his master‚Äôs absence. First he slung his sword over his</p>
<p>brawny shoulders and put on a thick cloak to keep out the wind. He also</p>
<p>took the skin of a large and well fed goat,</p>
<p>and a javelin in case of</p>
<p>attack from men or dogs. Thus equipped he went to his rest where the</p>
<p>pigs were camping under an overhanging rock that gave them shelter from</p>
<p>the North wind.</p>

<p>MINERVA SUMMONS TELEMACHUS FROM LACEDAEMON‚ÄîHE MEETS WITH THEOCLYMENUS</p>
<p>AT PYLOS AND BRINGS HIM TO ITHACA‚ÄîON LANDING HE GOES TO THE HUT OF</p>
<p>EUMAEUS.</p>
<p>But Minerva went to the fair city of Lacedaemon to tell Ulysses‚Äô son</p>
<p>that he was to return at once. She found him and Pisistratus sleeping</p>
<p>in the forecourt of Menelaus‚Äôs house; Pisistratus was fast asleep,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Telemachus could get no rest all night for thinking of his unhappy</p>
<p>father,</p>
<p>so Minerva went close up to him and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>you should not remain so far away from home any longer,</p>
<p>nor leave your property with such dangerous people in your house; they</p>
<p>will eat up everything you have among them,</p>
<p>and you will have been on a</p>
<p>fool‚Äôs errand. Ask Menelaus to send you home at once if you wish to</p>
<p>find your excellent mother still there when you get back. Her father</p>
<p>and brothers are already urging her to marry Eurymachus,</p>
<p>who has given</p>
<p>her more than any of the others,</p>
<p>and has been greatly increasing his</p>
<p>wedding presents. I hope nothing valuable may have been taken from the</p>
<p>house in spite of you,</p>
<p>but you know what women are‚Äîthey always want to</p>
<p>do the best they can for the man who marries them,</p>
<p>and never give</p>
<p>another thought to the children of their first husband,</p>
<p>nor to their</p>
<p>father either when he is dead and done with. Go home,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>put everything in charge of the most respectable woman servant that you</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>until it shall please heaven to send you a wife of your own. Let</p>
<p>me tell you also of another matter which you had better attend to. The</p>
<p>chief men among the suitors are lying in wait for you in the Strait128</p>
<p>between Ithaca and Samos,</p>
<p>and they mean to kill you before you can</p>
<p>reach home. I do not much think they will succeed; it is more likely</p>
<p>that some of those who are now eating up your property will find a</p>
<p>grave themselves. Sail night and day,</p>
<p>and keep your ship well away from</p>
<p>the islands; the god who watches over you and protects you will send</p>
<p>you a fair wind. As soon as you get to Ithaca send your ship and men on</p>
<p>to the town,</p>
<p>but yourself go straight to the swineherd who has charge</p>
<p>of your pigs; he is well disposed towards you,</p>
<p>stay with him,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>for the night,</p>
<p>and then send him to Penelope to tell her</p>
<p>that you have got back safe from Pylos.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then she went back to Olympus; but Telemachus stirred Pisistratus with</p>
<p>his heel to rouse him,</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWake up Pisistratus,</p>
<p>and yoke the</p>
<p>horses to the chariot,</p>
<p>for we must set off home.‚Äù129</p>
<p>But Pisistratus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo matter what hurry we are in we cannot drive</p>
<p>in the dark. It will be morning soon; wait till Menelaus has brought</p>
<p>his presents and put them in the chariot for us; and let him say good</p>
<p>bye to us in the usual way. So long as he lives a guest should never</p>
<p>forget a host who has shown him kindness.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke day began to break,</p>
<p>and Menelaus,</p>
<p>who had already risen,</p>
<p>leaving Helen in bed,</p>
<p>came towards them. When Telemachus saw him he put</p>
<p>on his shirt as fast as he could,</p>
<p>threw a great cloak over his</p>
<p>shoulders,</p>
<p>and went out to meet him. ‚ÄúMenelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúlet me go</p>
<p>back now to my own country,</p>
<p>for I want to get home.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Menelaus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>if you insist on going I will not</p>
<p>detain you. I do not like to see a host either too fond of his guest or</p>
<p>too rude to him. Moderation is best in all things,</p>
<p>and not letting a</p>
<p>man go when he wants to do so is as bad as telling him to go if he</p>
<p>would like to stay. One should treat a guest well as long as he is in</p>
<p>the house and speed him when he wants to leave it. Wait,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>till I</p>
<p>can get your beautiful presents into your chariot,</p>
<p>and till you have</p>
<p>yourself seen them. I will tell the women to prepare a sufficient</p>
<p>dinner for you of what there may be in the house; it will be at once</p>
<p>more proper and cheaper for you to get your dinner before setting out</p>
<p>on such a long journey. If,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>you have a fancy for making a</p>
<p>tour in Hellas or in the Peloponnese,</p>
<p>I will yoke my horses,</p>
<p>and will</p>
<p>conduct you myself through all our principal cities. No one will send</p>
<p>us away empty handed; every one will give us something‚Äîa bronze tripod,</p>
<p>a couple of mules,</p>
<p>or a gold cup.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMenelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI want to go home at once,</p>
<p>for when I</p>
<p>came away I left my property without protection,</p>
<p>and fear that while</p>
<p>looking for my father I shall come to ruin myself,</p>
<p>or find that</p>
<p>something valuable has been stolen during my absence.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Menelaus heard this he immediately told his wife and servants to</p>
<p>prepare a sufficient dinner from what there might be in the house. At</p>
<p>this moment Eteoneus joined him,</p>
<p>for he lived close by and had just got</p>
<p>up; so Menelaus told him to light the fire and cook some meat,</p>
<p>which he</p>
<p>at once did. Then Menelaus went down into his fragrant store room,</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>not alone,</p>
<p>but Helen went too,</p>
<p>with Megapenthes. When he reached the</p>
<p>place where the treasures of his house were kept,</p>
<p>he selected a double</p>
<p>cup,</p>
<p>and told his son Megapenthes to bring also a silver mixing bowl.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Helen went to the chest where she kept the lovely dresses</p>
<p>which she had made with her own hands,</p>
<p>and took out one that was</p>
<p>largest and most beautifully enriched with embroidery; it glittered</p>
<p>like a star,</p>
<p>and lay at the very bottom of the chest. 131 Then they all</p>
<p>came back through the house again till they got to Telemachus,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Menelaus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>may Jove,</p>
<p>the mighty husband of Juno,</p>
<p>bring</p>
<p>you safely home according to your desire. I will now present you with</p>
<p>the finest and most precious piece of plate in all my house. It is a</p>
<p>mixing bowl of pure silver,</p>
<p>except the rim,</p>
<p>which is inlaid with gold,</p>
<p>and it is the work of Vulcan. Phaedimus king of the Sidonians made me a</p>
<p>present of it in the course of a visit that I paid him while I was on</p>
<p>my return home. I should like to give it to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he placed the double cup in the hands of Telemachus,</p>
<p>while Megapenthes brought the beautiful mixing bowl and set it before</p>
<p>him. Hard by stood lovely Helen with the robe ready in her hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI too,</p>
<p>my son,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúhave something for you as a keepsake from</p>
<p>the hand of Helen; it is for your bride to wear upon her wedding day.</p>
<p>Till then,</p>
<p>get your dear mother to keep it for you; thus may you go</p>
<p>back rejoicing to your own country and to your home.‚Äù</p>
<p>So saying she gave the robe over to him and he received it gladly. Then</p>
<p>Pisistratus put the presents into the chariot,</p>
<p>and admired them all as</p>
<p>he did so. Presently Menelaus took Telemachus and Pisistratus into the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and they both of them sat down to table. A maid servant brought</p>
<p>them water in a beautiful golden ewer,</p>
<p>and poured it into a silver</p>
<p>basin for them to wash their hands,</p>
<p>and she drew a clean table beside</p>
<p>them; an upper servant brought them bread and offered them many good</p>
<p>things of what there was in the house. Eteoneus carved the meat and</p>
<p>gave them each their portions,</p>
<p>while Megapenthes poured out the wine.</p>
<p>Then they laid their hands upon the good things that were before them,</p>
<p>but as soon as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus and</p>
<p>Pisistratus yoked the horses,</p>
<p>and took their places in the chariot.</p>
<p>They drove out through the inner gateway and under the echoing</p>
<p>gatehouse of the outer court,</p>
<p>and Menelaus came after them with a</p>
<p>golden goblet of wine in his right hand that they might make a</p>
<p>drink-offering before they set out. He stood in front of the horses and</p>
<p>pledged them,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFarewell to both of you; see that you tell</p>
<p>Nestor how I have treated you,</p>
<p>for he was as kind to me as any father</p>
<p>could be while we Achaeans were fighting before Troy.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe will be sure,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúto tell him everything as</p>
<p>soon as we see him. I wish I were as certain of finding Ulysses</p>
<p>returned when I get back to Ithaca,</p>
<p>that I might tell him of the very</p>
<p>great kindness you have shown me and of the many beautiful presents I</p>
<p>am taking with me.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he was thus speaking a bird flew on his right hand‚Äîan eagle with a</p>
<p>great white goose in its talons which it had carried off from the farm</p>
<p>yard‚Äîand all the men and women were running after it and shouting. It</p>
<p>came quite close up to them and flew away on their right hands in front</p>
<p>of the horses. When they saw it they were glad,</p>
<p>and their hearts took</p>
<p>comfort within them,</p>
<p>whereon Pisistratus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTell me,</p>
<p>Menelaus,</p>
<p>has</p>
<p>heaven sent this omen for us or for you?‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus was thinking what would be the most proper answer for him to</p>
<p>make,</p>
<p>but Helen was too quick for him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will read this</p>
<p>matter as heaven has put it in my heart,</p>
<p>and as I doubt not that it</p>
<p>will come to pass. The eagle came from the mountain where it was bred</p>
<p>and has its nest,</p>
<p>and in like manner Ulysses,</p>
<p>after having travelled</p>
<p>far and suffered much,</p>
<p>will return to take his revenge‚Äîif indeed he is</p>
<p>not back already and hatching mischief for the suitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay Jove so grant it,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúif it should prove to be</p>
<p>so,</p>
<p>I will make vows to you as though you were a god,</p>
<p>even when I am at</p>
<p>home.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he lashed his horses and they started off at full speed</p>
<p>through the town towards the open country. They swayed the yoke upon</p>
<p>their necks and travelled the whole day long till the sun set and</p>
<p>darkness was over all the land. Then they reached Pherae,</p>
<p>where Diocles</p>
<p>lived who was son of Ortilochus,</p>
<p>the son of Alpheus. There they passed</p>
<p>the night and were treated hospitably. When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>they again yoked their horses and their</p>
<p>places in the chariot. They drove out through the inner gateway and</p>
<p>under the echoing gatehouse of the outer court. Then Pisistratus lashed</p>
<p>his horses on and they flew forward nothing loath; ere long they came</p>
<p>to Pylos,</p>
<p>and then Telemachus said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúPisistratus,</p>
<p>I hope you will promise to do what I am going to ask you.</p>
<p>You know our fathers were old friends before us; moreover,</p>
<p>we are both</p>
<p>of an age,</p>
<p>and this journey has brought us together still more closely;</p>
<p>do not,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>take me past my ship,</p>
<p>but leave me there,</p>
<p>for if I</p>
<p>go to your father‚Äôs house he will try to keep me in the warmth of his</p>
<p>good will towards me,</p>
<p>and I must go home at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>Pisistratus thought how he should do as he was asked,</p>
<p>and in the end he</p>
<p>deemed it best to turn his horses towards the ship,</p>
<p>and put Menelaus‚Äôs</p>
<p>beautiful presents of gold and raiment in the stern of the vessel. Then</p>
<p>he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo on board at once and tell your men to do so also before I</p>
<p>can reach home to tell my father. I know how obstinate he is,</p>
<p>and am</p>
<p>sure he will not let you go; he will come down here to fetch you,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>he will not go back without you. But he will be very angry.‚Äù</p>
<p>With this he drove his goodly steeds back to the city of the Pylians</p>
<p>and soon reached his home,</p>
<p>but Telemachus called the men together and</p>
<p>gave his orders. ‚ÄúNow,</p>
<p>my men,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúget everything in order on</p>
<p>board the ship,</p>
<p>and let us set out home.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they went on board even as he had said. But as</p>
<p>Telemachus was thus busied,</p>
<p>praying also and sacrificing to Minerva in</p>
<p>the ship‚Äôs stern,</p>
<p>there came to him a man from a distant country,</p>
<p>a</p>
<p>seer,</p>
<p>who was flying from Argos because he had killed a man. He was</p>
<p>descended from Melampus,</p>
<p>who used to live in Pylos,</p>
<p>the land of sheep;</p>
<p>he was rich and owned a great house,</p>
<p>but he was driven into exile by</p>
<p>the great and powerful king Neleus. Neleus seized his goods and held</p>
<p>them for a whole year,</p>
<p>during which he was a close prisoner in the</p>
<p>house of king Phylacus,</p>
<p>and in much distress of mind both on account of</p>
<p>the daughter of Neleus and because he was haunted by a great sorrow</p>
<p>that dread Erinys had laid upon him. In the end,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>he escaped</p>
<p>with his life,</p>
<p>drove the cattle from Phylace to Pylos,</p>
<p>avenged the</p>
<p>wrong that had been done him,</p>
<p>and gave the daughter of Neleus to his</p>
<p>brother. Then he left the country and went to Argos,</p>
<p>where it was</p>
<p>ordained that he should reign over much people. There he married,</p>
<p>established himself,</p>
<p>and had two famous sons Antiphates and Mantius.</p>
<p>Antiphates became father of Oicleus,</p>
<p>and Oicleus of Amphiaraus,</p>
<p>who was</p>
<p>dearly loved both by Jove and by Apollo,</p>
<p>but he did not live to old</p>
<p>age,</p>
<p>for he was killed in Thebes by reason of a woman‚Äôs gifts. His sons</p>
<p>were Alcmaeon and Amphilochus. Mantius,</p>
<p>the other son of Melampus,</p>
<p>was</p>
<p>father to Polypheides and Cleitus. Aurora,</p>
<p>throned in gold,</p>
<p>carried off</p>
<p>Cleitus for his beauty‚Äôs sake,</p>
<p>that he might dwell among the immortals,</p>
<p>but Apollo made Polypheides the greatest seer in the whole world now</p>
<p>that Amphiaraus was dead. He quarrelled with his father and went to</p>
<p>live in Hyperesia,</p>
<p>where he remained and prophesied for all men.</p>
<p>His son,</p>
<p>Theoclymenus,</p>
<p>it was who now came up to Telemachus as he was</p>
<p>making drink-offerings and praying in his ship. ‚ÄúFriend,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúnow</p>
<p>that I find you sacrificing in this place,</p>
<p>I beseech you by your</p>
<p>sacrifices themselves,</p>
<p>and by the god to whom you make them,</p>
<p>I pray you</p>
<p>also by your own head and by those of your followers tell me the truth</p>
<p>and nothing but the truth. Who and whence are you? Tell me also of your</p>
<p>town and parents.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will answer you quite truly. I am from Ithaca,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>my father is Ulysses,</p>
<p>as surely as that he ever lived. But he has come</p>
<p>to some miserable end. Therefore I have taken this ship and got my crew</p>
<p>together to see if I can hear any news of him,</p>
<p>for he has been away a</p>
<p>long time.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI too,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Theoclymenus,</p>
<p>‚Äúam an exile,</p>
<p>for I have killed a man</p>
<p>of my own race. He has many brothers and kinsmen in Argos,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>have great power among the Argives. I am flying to escape death at</p>
<p>their hands,</p>
<p>and am thus doomed to be a wanderer on the face of the</p>
<p>earth. I am your suppliant; take me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>on board your ship that</p>
<p>they may not kill me,</p>
<p>for I know they are in pursuit.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will not refuse you,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúif you wish to join us.</p>
<p>Come,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and in Ithaca we will treat you hospitably according</p>
<p>to what we have.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he received Theoclymenus‚Äô spear and laid it down on the deck of</p>
<p>the ship. He went on board and sat in the stern,</p>
<p>bidding Theoclymenus</p>
<p>sit beside him; then the men let go the hawsers. Telemachus told them</p>
<p>to catch hold of the ropes,</p>
<p>and they made all haste to do so. They set</p>
<p>the mast in its socket in the cross plank,</p>
<p>raised it and made it fast</p>
<p>with the forestays,</p>
<p>and they hoisted their white sails with sheets of</p>
<p>twisted ox hide. Minerva sent them a fair wind that blew fresh and</p>
<p>strong to take the ship on her course as fast as possible. Thus then</p>
<p>they passed by Crouni and Chalcis.</p>
<p>Presently the sun set and darkness was over all the land. The vessel</p>
<p>made a quick passage to Pheae and thence on to Elis,</p>
<p>where the Epeans</p>
<p>rule. Telemachus then headed her for the flying islands,</p>
<p>132 wondering</p>
<p>within himself whether he should escape death or should be taken</p>
<p>prisoner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd were eating their supper in the</p>
<p>hut,</p>
<p>and the men supped with them. As soon as they had had to eat and</p>
<p>drink,</p>
<p>Ulysses began trying to prove the swineherd and see whether he</p>
<p>would continue to treat him kindly,</p>
<p>and ask him to stay on at the</p>
<p>station or pack him off to the city; so he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>and all of you,</p>
<p>to-morrow I want to go away and begin begging</p>
<p>about the town,</p>
<p>so as to be no more trouble to you or to your men. Give</p>
<p>me your advice therefore,</p>
<p>and let me have a good guide to go with me</p>
<p>and show me the way. I will go the round of the city begging as I needs</p>
<p>must,</p>
<p>to see if any one will give me a drink and a piece of bread. I</p>
<p>should like also to go to the house of Ulysses and bring news of her</p>
<p>husband to Queen Penelope. I could then go about among the suitors and</p>
<p>see if out of all their abundance they will give me a dinner. I should</p>
<p>soon make them an excellent servant in all sorts of ways. Listen and</p>
<p>believe when I tell you that by the blessing of Mercury who gives grace</p>
<p>and good name to the works of all men,</p>
<p>there is no one living who would</p>
<p>make a more handy servant than I should‚Äîto put fresh wood on the fire,</p>
<p>chop fuel,</p>
<p>carve,</p>
<p>cook,</p>
<p>pour out wine,</p>
<p>and do all those services that</p>
<p>poor men have to do for their betters.‚Äù</p>
<p>The swineherd was very much disturbed when he heard this. ‚ÄúHeaven help</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat ever can have put such a notion as that into</p>
<p>your head? If you go near the suitors you will be undone to a</p>
<p>certainty,</p>
<p>for their pride and insolence reach the very heavens. They</p>
<p>would never think of taking a man like you for a servant. Their</p>
<p>servants are all young men,</p>
<p>well dressed,</p>
<p>wearing good cloaks and</p>
<p>shirts,</p>
<p>with well looking faces and their hair always tidy,</p>
<p>the tables</p>
<p>are kept quite clean and are loaded with bread,</p>
<p>meat,</p>
<p>and wine. Stay</p>
<p>where you are,</p>
<p>then; you are not in anybody‚Äôs way; I do not mind your</p>
<p>being here,</p>
<p>no more do any of the others,</p>
<p>and when Telemachus comes</p>
<p>home he will give you a shirt and cloak and will send you wherever you</p>
<p>want to go.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope you may be as dear to the gods as you are to</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>for having saved me from going about and getting into trouble;</p>
<p>there is nothing worse than being always on the tramp; still,</p>
<p>when men</p>
<p>have once got low down in the world they will go through a great deal</p>
<p>on behalf of their miserable bellies. Since,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>you press me to</p>
<p>stay here and await the return of Telemachus,</p>
<p>tell me about Ulysses‚Äô</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>and his father whom he left on the threshold of old age when he</p>
<p>set out for Troy. Are they still living or are they already dead and in</p>
<p>the house of Hades?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you all about them,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLaertes is still</p>
<p>living and prays heaven to let him depart peacefully in his own house,</p>
<p>for he is terribly distressed about the absence of his son,</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>about the death of his wife,</p>
<p>which grieved him greatly and aged him</p>
<p>more than anything else did. She came to an unhappy end133 through</p>
<p>sorrow for her son: may no friend or neighbour who has dealt kindly by</p>
<p>me come to such an end as she did. As long as she was still living,</p>
<p>though she was always grieving,</p>
<p>I used to like seeing her and asking</p>
<p>her how she did,</p>
<p>for she brought me up along with her daughter Ctimene,</p>
<p>the youngest of her children; we were boy and girl together,</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>made little difference between us. When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>we both grew up,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>sent Ctimene to Same and received a splendid dowry for her. As for me,</p>
<p>my mistress gave me a good shirt and cloak with a pair of sandals for</p>
<p>my feet,</p>
<p>and sent me off into the country,</p>
<p>but she was just as fond of</p>
<p>me as ever. This is all over now. Still it has pleased heaven to</p>
<p>prosper my work in the situation which I now hold. I have enough to eat</p>
<p>and drink,</p>
<p>and can find something for any respectable stranger who</p>
<p>comes here; but there is no getting a kind word or deed out of my</p>
<p>mistress,</p>
<p>for the house has fallen into the hands of wicked people.</p>
<p>Servants want sometimes to see their mistress and have a talk with her;</p>
<p>they like to have something to eat and drink at the house,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>something too to take back with them into the country. This is what</p>
<p>will keep servants in a good humour.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen you must have been a very little fellow,</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>when you were taken so far away from your home and parents.</p>
<p>Tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>was the city in which your father and mother</p>
<p>lived sacked and pillaged,</p>
<p>or did some enemies carry you off when you</p>
<p>were alone tending sheep or cattle,</p>
<p>ship you off here,</p>
<p>and sell you for</p>
<p>whatever your master gave them?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äúas regards your question: sit still,</p>
<p>make</p>
<p>yourself comfortable,</p>
<p>drink your wine,</p>
<p>and listen to me. The nights are</p>
<p>now at their longest; there is plenty of time both for sleeping and</p>
<p>sitting up talking together; you ought not to go to bed till bed time,</p>
<p>too much sleep is as bad as too little; if any one of the others wishes</p>
<p>to go to bed let him leave us and do so; he can then take my master‚Äôs</p>
<p>pigs out when he has done breakfast in the morning. We too will sit</p>
<p>here eating and drinking in the hut,</p>
<p>and telling one another stories</p>
<p>about our misfortunes; for when a man has suffered much,</p>
<p>and been</p>
<p>buffeted about in the world,</p>
<p>he takes pleasure in recalling the memory</p>
<p>of sorrows that have long gone by. As regards your question,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>my</p>
<p>tale is as follows:</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou may have heard of an island called Syra that lies over above</p>
<p>Ortygia,</p>
<p>134 where the land begins to turn round and look in another</p>
<p>direction.135 It is not very thickly peopled,</p>
<p>but the soil is good,</p>
<p>with much pasture fit for cattle and sheep,</p>
<p>and it abounds with wine</p>
<p>and wheat. Dearth never comes there,</p>
<p>nor are the people plagued by any</p>
<p>sickness,</p>
<p>but when they grow old Apollo comes with Diana and kills them</p>
<p>with his painless shafts. It contains two communities,</p>
<p>and the whole</p>
<p>country is divided between these two. My father Ctesius son of Ormenus,</p>
<p>a man comparable to the gods,</p>
<p>reigned over both.</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow to this place there came some cunning traders from Phoenicia (for</p>
<p>the Phoenicians are great mariners) in a ship which they had freighted</p>
<p>with gewgaws of all kinds. There happened to be a Phoenician woman in</p>
<p>my father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>very tall and comely,</p>
<p>and an excellent servant;</p>
<p>these scoundrels got hold of her one day when she was washing near</p>
<p>their ship,</p>
<p>seduced her,</p>
<p>and cajoled her in ways that no woman can</p>
<p>resist,</p>
<p>no matter how good she may be by nature. The man who had</p>
<p>seduced her asked her who she was and where she came from,</p>
<p>and on this</p>
<p>she told him her father‚Äôs name. ‚ÄòI come from Sidon,</p>
<p>‚Äô said she,</p>
<p>‚Äòand am</p>
<p>daughter to Arybas,</p>
<p>a man rolling in wealth. One day as I was coming</p>
<p>into the town from the country,</p>
<p>some Taphian pirates seized me and took</p>
<p>me here over the sea,</p>
<p>where they sold me to the man who owns this</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and he gave them their price for me.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe man who had seduced her then said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòWould you like to come along</p>
<p>with us to see the house of your parents and your parents themselves?</p>
<p>They are both alive and are said to be well off.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚Äú‚ÄòI will do so gladly,</p>
<p>‚Äô answered she,</p>
<p>‚Äòif you men will first swear me a</p>
<p>solemn oath that you will do me no harm by the way.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThey all swore as she told them,</p>
<p>and when they had completed their</p>
<p>oath the woman said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòHush; and if any of your men meets me in the</p>
<p>street or at the well,</p>
<p>do not let him speak to me,</p>
<p>for fear some one</p>
<p>should go and tell my master,</p>
<p>in which case he would suspect something.</p>
<p>He would put me in prison,</p>
<p>and would have all of you murdered; keep</p>
<p>your own counsel therefore; buy your merchandise as fast as you can,</p>
<p>and send me word when you have done loading. I will bring as much gold</p>
<p>as I can lay my hands on,</p>
<p>and there is something else also that I can</p>
<p>do towards paying my fare. I am nurse to the son of the good man of the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>a funny little fellow just able to run about. I will carry him</p>
<p>off in your ship,</p>
<p>and you will get a great deal of money for him if you</p>
<p>take him and sell him in foreign parts.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúOn this she went back to the house. The Phoenicians stayed a whole</p>
<p>year till they had loaded their ship with much precious merchandise,</p>
<p>and then,</p>
<p>when they had got freight enough,</p>
<p>they sent to tell the</p>
<p>woman. Their messenger,</p>
<p>a very cunning fellow,</p>
<p>came to my father‚Äôs</p>
<p>house bringing a necklace of gold with amber beads strung among it; and</p>
<p>while my mother and the servants had it in their hands admiring it and</p>
<p>bargaining about it,</p>
<p>he made a sign quietly to the woman and then went</p>
<p>back to the ship,</p>
<p>whereon she took me by the hand and led me out of the</p>
<p>house. In the fore part of the house she saw the tables set with the</p>
<p>cups of guests who had been feasting with my father,</p>
<p>as being in</p>
<p>attendance on him; these were now all gone to a meeting of the public</p>
<p>assembly,</p>
<p>so she snatched up three cups and carried them off in the</p>
<p>bosom of her dress,</p>
<p>while I followed her,</p>
<p>for I knew no better. The sun</p>
<p>was now set,</p>
<p>and darkness was over all the land,</p>
<p>so we hurried on as</p>
<p>fast as we could till we reached the harbour,</p>
<p>where the Phoenician ship</p>
<p>was lying. When they had got on board they sailed their ways over the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>taking us with them,</p>
<p>and Jove sent then a fair wind; six days did</p>
<p>we sail both night and day,</p>
<p>but on the seventh day Diana struck the</p>
<p>woman and she fell heavily down into the ship‚Äôs hold as though she were</p>
<p>a sea gull alighting on the water; so they threw her overboard to the</p>
<p>seals and fishes,</p>
<p>and I was left all sorrowful and alone. Presently the</p>
<p>winds and waves took the ship to Ithaca,</p>
<p>where Laertes gave sundry of</p>
<p>his chattels for me,</p>
<p>and thus it was that ever I came to set eyes upon</p>
<p>this country.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>I have heard the story of your misfortunes</p>
<p>with the most lively interest and pity,</p>
<p>but Jove has given you good as</p>
<p>well as evil,</p>
<p>for in spite of everything you have a good master,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>sees that you always have enough to eat and drink; and you lead a good</p>
<p>life,</p>
<p>whereas I am still going about begging my way from city to city.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse,</p>
<p>and they had only a very little time left for</p>
<p>sleep,</p>
<p>for it was soon daybreak. In the mean time Telemachus and his</p>
<p>crew were nearing land,</p>
<p>so they loosed the sails,</p>
<p>took down the mast,</p>
<p>and rowed the ship into the harbour.136 They cast out their mooring</p>
<p>stones and made fast the hawsers; they then got out upon the sea shore,</p>
<p>mixed their wine,</p>
<p>and got dinner ready. As soon as they had had enough</p>
<p>to eat and drink Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake the ship on to the town,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>leave me here,</p>
<p>for I want to look after the herdsmen on one of my</p>
<p>farms. In the evening,</p>
<p>when I have seen all I want,</p>
<p>I will come down to</p>
<p>the city,</p>
<p>and to-morrow morning in return for your trouble I will give</p>
<p>you all a good dinner with meat and wine.‚Äù 137</p>
<p>Then Theoclymenus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAnd what,</p>
<p>my dear young friend,</p>
<p>is to become</p>
<p>of me? To whose house,</p>
<p>among all your chief men,</p>
<p>am I to repair? or</p>
<p>shall I go straight to your own house and to your mother?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAt any other time,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI should have bidden you go</p>
<p>to my own house,</p>
<p>for you would find no want of hospitality; at the</p>
<p>present moment,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>you would not be comfortable there,</p>
<p>for I</p>
<p>shall be away,</p>
<p>and my mother will not see you; she does not often show</p>
<p>herself even to the suitors,</p>
<p>but sits at her loom weaving in an upper</p>
<p>chamber,</p>
<p>out of their way; but I can tell you a man whose house you can</p>
<p>go to‚ÄîI mean Eurymachus the son of Polybus,</p>
<p>who is held in the highest</p>
<p>estimation by every one in Ithaca. He is much the best man and the most</p>
<p>persistent wooer,</p>
<p>of all those who are paying court to my mother and</p>
<p>trying to take Ulysses‚Äô place. Jove,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>in heaven alone knows</p>
<p>whether or no they will come to a bad end before the marriage takes</p>
<p>place.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he was speaking a bird flew by upon his right hand‚Äîa hawk,</p>
<p>Apollo‚Äôs</p>
<p>messenger. It held a dove in its talons,</p>
<p>and the feathers,</p>
<p>as it tore</p>
<p>them off,</p>
<p>138 fell to the ground midway between Telemachus and the ship.</p>
<p>On this Theoclymenus called him apart and caught him by the hand.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat bird did not fly on your right hand</p>
<p>without having been sent there by some god. As soon as I saw it I knew</p>
<p>it was an omen; it means that you will remain powerful and that there</p>
<p>will be no house in Ithaca more royal than your own.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish it may prove so,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus. ‚ÄúIf it does,</p>
<p>I will show</p>
<p>you so much good will and give you so many presents that all who meet</p>
<p>you will congratulate you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he said to his friend Piraeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúPiraeus,</p>
<p>son of Clytius,</p>
<p>you have</p>
<p>throughout shown yourself the most willing to serve me of all those who</p>
<p>have accompanied me to Pylos; I wish you would take this stranger to</p>
<p>your own house and entertain him hospitably till I can come for him.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Piraeus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>you may stay away as long as you</p>
<p>please,</p>
<p>but I will look after him for you,</p>
<p>and he shall find no lack of</p>
<p>hospitality.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he went on board,</p>
<p>and bade the others do so also and loose</p>
<p>the hawsers,</p>
<p>so they took their places in the ship. But Telemachus</p>
<p>bound on his sandals,</p>
<p>and took a long and doughty spear with a head of</p>
<p>sharpened bronze from the deck of the ship. Then they loosed the</p>
<p>hawsers,</p>
<p>thrust the ship off from land,</p>
<p>and made on towards the city as</p>
<p>they had been told to do,</p>
<p>while Telemachus strode on as fast as he</p>
<p>could,</p>
<p>till he reached the homestead where his countless herds of swine</p>
<p>were feeding,</p>
<p>and where dwelt the excellent swineherd,</p>
<p>who was so</p>
<p>devoted a servant to his master.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XVI</span>
<p>ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO TELEMACHUS.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ulysses and the swineherd had lit a fire in the hut and were</p>
<p>were getting breakfast ready at daybreak,</p>
<p>for they had sent the men out</p>
<p>with the pigs. When Telemachus came up,</p>
<p>the dogs did not bark but</p>
<p>fawned upon him,</p>
<p>so Ulysses,</p>
<p>hearing the sound of feet and noticing</p>
<p>that the dogs did not bark,</p>
<p>said to Eumaeus:</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>I hear footsteps; I suppose one of your men or some one of</p>
<p>your acquaintance is coming here,</p>
<p>for the dogs are fawning upon him and</p>
<p>not barking.‚Äù</p>
<p>The words were hardly out of his mouth before his son stood at the</p>
<p>door. Eumaeus sprang to his feet,</p>
<p>and the bowls in which he was mixing</p>
<p>wine fell from his hands,</p>
<p>as he made towards his master. He kissed his</p>
<p>head and both his beautiful eyes,</p>
<p>and wept for joy. A father could not</p>
<p>be more delighted at the return of an only son,</p>
<p>the child of his old</p>
<p>age,</p>
<p>after ten years‚Äô absence in a foreign country and after having</p>
<p>gone through much hardship. He embraced him,</p>
<p>kissed him all over as</p>
<p>though he had come back from the dead,</p>
<p>and spoke fondly to him saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo you are come,</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>light of my eyes that you are. When I</p>
<p>heard you had gone to Pylos I made sure I was never going to see you</p>
<p>any more. Come in,</p>
<p>my dear child,</p>
<p>and sit down,</p>
<p>that I may have a good</p>
<p>look at you now you are home again; it is not very often you come into</p>
<p>the country to see us herdsmen; you stick pretty close to the town</p>
<p>generally. I suppose you think it better to keep an eye on what the</p>
<p>suitors are doing.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSo be it,</p>
<p>old friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúbut I am come now because</p>
<p>I want to see you,</p>
<p>and to learn whether my mother is still at her old</p>
<p>home or whether some one else has married her,</p>
<p>so that the bed of</p>
<p>Ulysses is without bedding and covered with cobwebs.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúShe is still at the house,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äúgrieving and breaking</p>
<p>her heart,</p>
<p>and doing nothing but weep,</p>
<p>both night and day continually.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he took Telemachus‚Äô spear,</p>
<p>whereon he crossed the stone</p>
<p>threshold and came inside. Ulysses rose from his seat to give him place</p>
<p>as he entered,</p>
<p>but Telemachus checked him; ‚ÄúSit down,</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI can easily find another seat,</p>
<p>and there is one here who will lay</p>
<p>it for me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses went back to his own place,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus strewed some green</p>
<p>brushwood on the floor and threw a sheepskin on top of it for</p>
<p>Telemachus to sit upon. Then the swineherd brought them platters of</p>
<p>cold meat,</p>
<p>the remains from what they had eaten the day before,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>filled the bread baskets with bread as fast as he could. He mixed wine</p>
<p>also in bowls of ivy-wood,</p>
<p>and took his seat facing Ulysses. Then they</p>
<p>laid their hands on the good things that were before them,</p>
<p>and as soon</p>
<p>as they had had enough to eat and drink Telemachus said to Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld friend,</p>
<p>where does this stranger come from? How did his crew bring</p>
<p>him to Ithaca,</p>
<p>and who were they?‚Äîfor assuredly he did not come here by</p>
<p>land.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy son,</p>
<p>I will tell you the</p>
<p>real truth. He says he is a Cretan,</p>
<p>and that he has been a great</p>
<p>traveller. At this moment he is running away from a Thesprotian ship,</p>
<p>and has taken refuge at my station,</p>
<p>so I will put him into your hands.</p>
<p>Do whatever you like with him,</p>
<p>only remember that he is your</p>
<p>suppliant.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am very much distressed,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúby what you have just</p>
<p>told me. How can I take this stranger into my house? I am as yet young,</p>
<p>and am not strong enough to hold my own if any man attacks me. My</p>
<p>mother cannot make up her mind whether to stay where she is and look</p>
<p>after the house out of respect for public opinion and the memory of her</p>
<p>husband,</p>
<p>or whether the time is now come for her to take the best man</p>
<p>of those who are wooing her,</p>
<p>and the one who will make her the most</p>
<p>advantageous offer; still,</p>
<p>as the stranger has come to your station I</p>
<p>will find him a cloak and shirt of good wear,</p>
<p>with a sword and sandals,</p>
<p>and will send him wherever he wants to go. Or if you like you can keep</p>
<p>him here at the station,</p>
<p>and I will send him clothes and food that he</p>
<p>may be no burden on you and on your men; but I will not have him go</p>
<p>near the suitors,</p>
<p>for they are very insolent,</p>
<p>and are sure to ill treat</p>
<p>him in a way that would greatly grieve me; no matter how valiant a man</p>
<p>may be he can do nothing against numbers,</p>
<p>for they will be too strong</p>
<p>for him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>it is right that I should say something</p>
<p>myself. I am much shocked about what you have said about the insolent</p>
<p>way in which the suitors are behaving in despite of such a man as you</p>
<p>are. Tell me,</p>
<p>do you submit to such treatment tamely,</p>
<p>or has some god</p>
<p>set your people against you? May you not complain of your brothers‚Äîfor</p>
<p>it is to these that a man may look for support,</p>
<p>however great his</p>
<p>quarrel may be? I wish I were as young as you are and in my present</p>
<p>mind; if I were son to Ulysses,</p>
<p>or,</p>
<p>indeed,</p>
<p>Ulysses himself,</p>
<p>I would</p>
<p>rather some one came and cut my head off,</p>
<p>but I would go to the house</p>
<p>and be the bane of every one of these men.139 If they were too many for</p>
<p>me‚ÄîI being single-handed‚ÄîI would rather die fighting in my own house</p>
<p>than see such disgraceful sights day after day,</p>
<p>strangers grossly</p>
<p>maltreated,</p>
<p>and men dragging the women servants about the house in an</p>
<p>unseemly way,</p>
<p>wine drawn recklessly,</p>
<p>and bread wasted all to no purpose</p>
<p>for an end that shall never be accomplished.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you truly everything. There is no</p>
<p>enmity between me and my people,</p>
<p>nor can I complain of brothers,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>whom a man may look for support however great his quarrel may be. Jove</p>
<p>has made us a race of only sons. Laertes was the only son of Arceisius,</p>
<p>and Ulysses only son of Laertes. I am myself the only son of Ulysses</p>
<p>who left me behind him when he went away,</p>
<p>so that I have never been of</p>
<p>any use to him. Hence it comes that my house is in the hands of</p>
<p>numberless marauders; for the chiefs from all the neighbouring islands,</p>
<p>Dulichium,</p>
<p>Same,</p>
<p>Zacynthus,</p>
<p>as also all the principal men of Ithaca</p>
<p>itself,</p>
<p>are eating up my house under the pretext of paying court to my</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>who will neither say point blank that she will not marry,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>yet bring matters to an end,</p>
<p>so they are making havoc of my estate,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>before long will do so with myself into the bargain. The issue,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>rests with heaven. But do you,</p>
<p>old friend Eumaeus,</p>
<p>go at once</p>
<p>and tell Penelope that I am safe and have returned from Pylos. Tell it</p>
<p>to herself alone,</p>
<p>and then come back here without letting any one else</p>
<p>know,</p>
<p>for there are many who are plotting mischief against me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand and heed you,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus; ‚Äúyou need instruct me no</p>
<p>further,</p>
<p>only as I am going that way say whether I had not better let</p>
<p>poor Laertes know that you are returned. He used to superintend the</p>
<p>work on his farm in spite of his bitter sorrow about Ulysses,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>would eat and drink at will along with his servants; but they tell me</p>
<p>that from the day on which you set out for Pylos he has neither eaten</p>
<p>nor drunk as he ought to do,</p>
<p>nor does he look after his farm,</p>
<p>but sits</p>
<p>weeping and wasting the flesh from off his bones.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMore‚Äôs the pity,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am sorry for him,</p>
<p>but we</p>
<p>must leave him to himself just now. If people could have everything</p>
<p>their own way,</p>
<p>the first thing I should choose would be the return of</p>
<p>my father; but go,</p>
<p>and give your message; then make haste back again,</p>
<p>and do not turn out of your way to tell Laertes. Tell my mother to send</p>
<p>one of her women secretly with the news at once,</p>
<p>and let him hear it</p>
<p>from her.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he urge the swineherd; Eumaeus,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>took his sandals,</p>
<p>bound them to his feet,</p>
<p>and started for the town. Minerva watched him</p>
<p>well off the station,</p>
<p>and then came up to it in the form of a</p>
<p>woman‚Äîfair,</p>
<p>stately,</p>
<p>and wise. She stood against the side of the entry,</p>
<p>and revealed herself to Ulysses,</p>
<p>but Telemachus could not see her,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>knew not that she was there,</p>
<p>for the gods do not let themselves be seen</p>
<p>by everybody. Ulysses saw her,</p>
<p>and so did the dogs,</p>
<p>for they did not</p>
<p>bark,</p>
<p>but went scared and whining off to the other side of the yards.</p>
<p>She nodded her head and motioned to Ulysses with her eyebrows; whereon</p>
<p>he left the hut and stood before her outside the main wall of the</p>
<p>yards. Then she said to him:</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>it is now time for you to tell your</p>
<p>son: do not keep him in the dark any longer,</p>
<p>but lay your plans for the</p>
<p>destruction of the suitors,</p>
<p>and then make for the town. I will not be</p>
<p>long in joining you,</p>
<p>for I too am eager for the fray.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke she touched him with her golden wand. First she threw a</p>
<p>fair clean shirt and cloak about his shoulders; then she made him</p>
<p>younger and of more imposing presence; she gave him back his colour,</p>
<p>filled out his cheeks,</p>
<p>and let his beard become dark again. Then she</p>
<p>went away and Ulysses came back inside the hut. His son was astounded</p>
<p>when he saw him,</p>
<p>and turned his eyes away for fear he might be looking</p>
<p>upon a god.</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúhow suddenly you have changed from what you were</p>
<p>a moment or two ago. You are dressed differently and your colour is not</p>
<p>the same. Are you some one or other of the gods that live in heaven? If</p>
<p>so,</p>
<p>be propitious to me till I can make you due sacrifice and offerings</p>
<p>of wrought gold. Have mercy upon me.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am no god,</p>
<p>why should you take me for one? I am</p>
<p>your father,</p>
<p>on whose account you grieve and suffer so much at the</p>
<p>hands of lawless men.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he kissed his son,</p>
<p>and a tear fell from his cheek on to the</p>
<p>ground,</p>
<p>for he had restrained all tears till now. But Telemachus could</p>
<p>not yet believe that it was his father,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou are not my father,</p>
<p>but some god is flattering me with vain hopes</p>
<p>that I may grieve the more hereafter; no mortal man could of himself</p>
<p>contrive to do as you have been doing,</p>
<p>and make yourself old and young</p>
<p>at a moment‚Äôs notice,</p>
<p>unless a god were with him. A second ago you were</p>
<p>old and all in rags,</p>
<p>and now you are like some god come down from</p>
<p>heaven.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>you ought not to be so immeasurably</p>
<p>astonished at my being really here. There is no other Ulysses who will</p>
<p>come hereafter. Such as I am,</p>
<p>it is I,</p>
<p>who after long wandering and</p>
<p>much hardship have got home in the twentieth year to my own country.</p>
<p>What you wonder at is the work of the redoubtable goddess Minerva,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>does with me whatever she will,</p>
<p>for she can do what she pleases. At one</p>
<p>moment she makes me like a beggar,</p>
<p>and the next I am a young man with</p>
<p>good clothes on my back; it is an easy matter for the gods who live in</p>
<p>heaven to make any man look either rich or poor.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he sat down,</p>
<p>and Telemachus threw his arms about his father</p>
<p>and wept. They were both so much moved that they cried aloud like</p>
<p>eagles or vultures with crooked talons that have been robbed of their</p>
<p>half fledged young by peasants. Thus piteously did they weep,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>sun would have gone down upon their mourning if Telemachus had not</p>
<p>suddenly said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn what ship,</p>
<p>my dear father,</p>
<p>did your crew bring you</p>
<p>to Ithaca? Of what nation did they declare themselves to be‚Äîfor you</p>
<p>cannot have come by land?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you the truth,</p>
<p>my son,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses. ‚ÄúIt was the</p>
<p>Phaeacians who brought me here. They are great sailors,</p>
<p>and are in the</p>
<p>habit of giving escorts to any one who reaches their coasts. They took</p>
<p>me over the sea while I was fast asleep,</p>
<p>and landed me in Ithaca,</p>
<p>after</p>
<p>giving me many presents in bronze,</p>
<p>gold,</p>
<p>and raiment. These things by</p>
<p>heaven‚Äôs mercy are lying concealed in a cave,</p>
<p>and I am now come here on</p>
<p>the suggestion of Minerva that we may consult about killing our</p>
<p>enemies. First,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>give me a list of the suitors,</p>
<p>with their</p>
<p>number,</p>
<p>that I may learn who,</p>
<p>and how many,</p>
<p>they are. I can then turn</p>
<p>the matter over in my mind,</p>
<p>and see whether we two can fight the whole</p>
<p>body of them ourselves,</p>
<p>or whether we must find others to help us.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>I have always heard of your</p>
<p>renown both in the field and in council,</p>
<p>but the task you talk of is a</p>
<p>very great one: I am awed at the mere thought of it; two men cannot</p>
<p>stand against many and brave ones. There are not ten suitors only,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>twice ten,</p>
<p>but ten many times over; you shall learn their number at</p>
<p>once. There are fifty-two chosen youths from Dulichium,</p>
<p>and they have</p>
<p>six servants; from Same there are twenty-four; twenty young Achaeans</p>
<p>from Zacynthus,</p>
<p>and twelve from Ithaca itself,</p>
<p>all of them well born.</p>
<p>They have with them a servant Medon,</p>
<p>a bard,</p>
<p>and two men who can carve</p>
<p>at table. If we face such numbers as this,</p>
<p>you may have bitter cause to</p>
<p>rue your coming,</p>
<p>and your revenge. See whether you cannot think of some</p>
<p>one who would be willing to come and help us.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúListen to me,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúand think whether Minerva and her</p>
<p>father Jove may seem sufficient,</p>
<p>or whether I am to try and find some</p>
<p>one else as well.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose whom you have named,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúare a couple of good</p>
<p>allies,</p>
<p>for though they dwell high up among the clouds they have power</p>
<p>over both gods and men.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThese two,</p>
<p>‚Äù continued Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúwill not keep long out of the fray,</p>
<p>when the suitors and we join fight in my house. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>return</p>
<p>home early to-morrow morning,</p>
<p>and go about among the suitors as before.</p>
<p>Later on the swineherd will bring me to the city disguised as a</p>
<p>miserable old beggar. If you see them ill treating me,</p>
<p>steel your heart</p>
<p>against my sufferings; even though they drag me feet foremost out of</p>
<p>the house,</p>
<p>or throw things at me,</p>
<p>look on and do nothing beyond gently</p>
<p>trying to make them behave more reasonably; but they will not listen to</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>for the day of their reckoning is at hand. Furthermore I say,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>lay my saying to your heart; when Minerva shall put it in my mind,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>will nod my head to you,</p>
<p>and on seeing me do this you must collect all</p>
<p>the armour that is in the house and hide it in the strong store room.</p>
<p>Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you are removing it; say</p>
<p>that you have taken it to be out of the way of the smoke,</p>
<p>inasmuch as</p>
<p>it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away,</p>
<p>but has become</p>
<p>soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more particularly that you</p>
<p>are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over their wine,</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>they may do each other some harm which may disgrace both banquet and</p>
<p>wooing,</p>
<p>for the sight of arms sometimes tempts people to use them. But</p>
<p>leave a sword and a spear apiece for yourself and me,</p>
<p>and a couple of</p>
<p>oxhide shields so that we can snatch them up at any moment; Jove and</p>
<p>Minerva will then soon quiet these people. There is also another</p>
<p>matter; if you are indeed my son and my blood runs in your veins,</p>
<p>let</p>
<p>no one know that Ulysses is within the house‚Äîneither Laertes,</p>
<p>nor yet</p>
<p>the swineherd,</p>
<p>nor any of the servants,</p>
<p>nor even Penelope herself. Let</p>
<p>you and me exploit the women alone,</p>
<p>and let us also make trial of some</p>
<p>other of the men servants,</p>
<p>to see who is on our side and whose hand is</p>
<p>against us.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou will come to know me by and by,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>when you do you will find that I can keep your counsel. I do not think,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>the plan you propose will turn out well for either of us.</p>
<p>Think it over. It will take us a long time to go the round of the farms</p>
<p>and exploit the men,</p>
<p>and all the time the suitors will be wasting your</p>
<p>estate with impunity and without compunction. Prove the women by all</p>
<p>means,</p>
<p>to see who are disloyal and who guiltless,</p>
<p>but I am not in</p>
<p>favour of going round and trying the men. We can attend to that later</p>
<p>on,</p>
<p>if you really have some sign from Jove that he will support you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse,</p>
<p>and meanwhile the ship which had brought</p>
<p>Telemachus and his crew from Pylos had reached the town of Ithaca. When</p>
<p>they had come inside the harbour they drew the ship on to the land;</p>
<p>their servants came and took their armour from them,</p>
<p>and they left all</p>
<p>the presents at the house of Clytius. Then they sent a servant to tell</p>
<p>Penelope that Telemachus had gone into the country,</p>
<p>but had sent the</p>
<p>ship to the town to prevent her from being alarmed and made unhappy.</p>
<p>This servant and Eumaeus happened to meet when they were both on the</p>
<p>same errand of going to tell Penelope. When they reached the House,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>servant stood up and said to the queen in the presence of the waiting</p>
<p>women,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour son,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>is now returned from Pylos‚Äù; but Eumaeus went</p>
<p>close up to Penelope,</p>
<p>and said privately all that her son had bidden</p>
<p>him tell her. When he had given his message he left the house with its</p>
<p>outbuildings and went back to his pigs again.</p>
<p>The suitors were surprised and angry at what had happened,</p>
<p>so they went</p>
<p>outside the great wall that ran round the outer court,</p>
<p>and held a</p>
<p>council near the main entrance. Eurymachus,</p>
<p>son of Polybus,</p>
<p>was the</p>
<p>first to speak.</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthis voyage of Telemachus‚Äôs is a very serious</p>
<p>matter; we had made sure that it would come to nothing. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>let us draw a ship into the water,</p>
<p>and get a crew together to send</p>
<p>after the others and tell them to come back as fast as they can.‚Äù</p>
<p>He had hardly done speaking when Amphinomus turned in his place and saw</p>
<p>the ship inside the harbour,</p>
<p>with the crew lowering her sails,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>putting by their oars; so he laughed,</p>
<p>and said to the others,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe need</p>
<p>not send them any message,</p>
<p>for they are here. Some god must have told</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>or else they saw the ship go by,</p>
<p>and could not overtake her.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this they rose and went to the water side. The crew then drew the</p>
<p>ship on shore; their servants took their armour from them,</p>
<p>and they</p>
<p>went up in a body to the place of assembly,</p>
<p>but they would not let any</p>
<p>one old or young sit along with them,</p>
<p>and Antinous,</p>
<p>son of Eupeithes,</p>
<p>spoke first.</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood heavens,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúsee how the gods have saved this man from</p>
<p>destruction. We kept a succession of scouts upon the headlands all day</p>
<p>long,</p>
<p>and when the sun was down we never went on shore to sleep,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>waited in the ship all night till morning in the hope of capturing and</p>
<p>killing him; but some god has conveyed him home in spite of us. Let us</p>
<p>consider how we can make an end of him. He must not escape us; our</p>
<p>affair is never likely to come off while he is alive,</p>
<p>for he is very</p>
<p>shrewd,</p>
<p>and public feeling is by no means all on our side. We must make</p>
<p>haste before he can call the Achaeans in assembly; he will lose no time</p>
<p>in doing so,</p>
<p>for he will be furious with us,</p>
<p>and will tell all the</p>
<p>world how we plotted to kill him,</p>
<p>but failed to take him. The people</p>
<p>will not like this when they come to know of it; we must see that they</p>
<p>do us no hurt,</p>
<p>nor drive us from our own country into exile. Let us try</p>
<p>and lay hold of him either on his farm away from the town,</p>
<p>or on the</p>
<p>road hither. Then we can divide up his property amongst us,</p>
<p>and let his</p>
<p>mother and the man who marries her have the house. If this does not</p>
<p>please you,</p>
<p>and you wish Telemachus to live on and hold his father‚Äôs</p>
<p>property,</p>
<p>then we must not gather here and eat up his goods in this</p>
<p>way,</p>
<p>but must make our offers to Penelope each from his own house,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>she can marry the man who will give the most for her,</p>
<p>and whose lot it</p>
<p>is to win her.‚Äù</p>
<p>They all held their peace until Amphinomus rose to speak. He was the</p>
<p>son of Nisus,</p>
<p>who was son to king Aretias,</p>
<p>and he was foremost among</p>
<p>all the suitors from the wheat-growing and well grassed island of</p>
<p>Dulichium; his conversation,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>was more agreeable to Penelope</p>
<p>than that of any of the other suitors,</p>
<p>for he was a man of good natural</p>
<p>disposition. ‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>speaking to them plainly and in all</p>
<p>honestly,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not in favour of killing Telemachus. It is a heinous</p>
<p>thing to kill one who is of noble blood. Let us first take counsel of</p>
<p>the gods,</p>
<p>and if the oracles of Jove advise it,</p>
<p>I will both help to</p>
<p>kill him myself,</p>
<p>and will urge everyone else to do so; but if they</p>
<p>dissuade us,</p>
<p>I would have you hold your hands.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and his words pleased them well,</p>
<p>so they rose</p>
<p>forthwith and went to the house of Ulysses,</p>
<p>where they took their</p>
<p>accustomed seats.</p>
<p>Then Penelope resolved that she would show herself to the suitors. She</p>
<p>knew of the plot against Telemachus,</p>
<p>for the servant Medon had</p>
<p>overheard their counsels and had told her; she went down therefore to</p>
<p>the court attended by her maidens,</p>
<p>and when she reached the suitors she</p>
<p>stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister</p>
<p>holding a veil before her face,</p>
<p>and rebuked Antinous saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>insolent and wicked schemer,</p>
<p>they say you are the best</p>
<p>speaker and counsellor of any man your own age in Ithaca,</p>
<p>but you are</p>
<p>nothing of the kind. Madman,</p>
<p>why should you try to compass the death of</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>and take no heed of suppliants,</p>
<p>whose witness is Jove</p>
<p>himself? It is not right for you to plot thus against one another. Do</p>
<p>you not remember how your father fled to this house in fear of the</p>
<p>people,</p>
<p>who were enraged against him for having gone with some Taphian</p>
<p>pirates and plundered the Thesprotians who were at peace with us? They</p>
<p>wanted to tear him in pieces and eat up everything he had,</p>
<p>but Ulysses</p>
<p>stayed their hands although they were infuriated,</p>
<p>and now you devour</p>
<p>his property without paying for it,</p>
<p>and break my heart by wooing his</p>
<p>wife and trying to kill his son. Leave off doing so,</p>
<p>and stop the</p>
<p>others also.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Eurymachus son of Polybus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake heart,</p>
<p>Queen Penelope</p>
<p>daughter of Icarius,</p>
<p>and do not trouble yourself about these matters.</p>
<p>The man is not yet born,</p>
<p>nor never will be,</p>
<p>who shall lay hands upon</p>
<p>your son Telemachus,</p>
<p>while I yet live to look upon the face of the</p>
<p>earth. I say‚Äîand it shall surely be‚Äîthat my spear shall be reddened</p>
<p>with his blood; for many a time has Ulysses taken me on his knees,</p>
<p>held</p>
<p>wine up to my lips to drink,</p>
<p>and put pieces of meat into my hands.</p>
<p>Therefore Telemachus is much the dearest friend I have,</p>
<p>and has nothing</p>
<p>to fear from the hands of us suitors. Of course,</p>
<p>if death comes to him</p>
<p>from the gods,</p>
<p>he cannot escape it.‚Äù He said this to quiet her,</p>
<p>but in</p>
<p>reality he was plotting against Telemachus.</p>
<p>Then Penelope went upstairs again and mourned her husband till Minerva</p>
<p>shed sleep over her eyes. In the evening Eumaeus got back to Ulysses</p>
<p>and his son,</p>
<p>who had just sacrificed a young pig of a year old and were</p>
<p>helping one another to get supper ready; Minerva therefore came up to</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>turned him into an old man with a stroke of her wand,</p>
<p>and clad</p>
<p>him in his old clothes again,</p>
<p>for fear that the swineherd might</p>
<p>recognise him and not keep the secret,</p>
<p>but go and tell Penelope.</p>
<p>Telemachus was the first to speak. ‚ÄúSo you have got back,</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äù</p>
<p>said he. ‚ÄúWhat is the news of the town? Have the suitors returned,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>are they still waiting over yonder,</p>
<p>to take me on my way home?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI did not think of asking about that,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhen I was in</p>
<p>the town. I thought I would give my message and come back as soon as I</p>
<p>could. I met a man sent by those who had gone with you to Pylos,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>was the first to tell the news to your mother,</p>
<p>but I can say what I saw</p>
<p>with my own eyes; I had just got on to the crest of the hill of Mercury</p>
<p>above the town when I saw a ship coming into harbour with a number of</p>
<p>men in her. They had many shields and spears,</p>
<p>and I thought it was the</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>but I cannot be sure.‚Äù</p>
<p>On hearing this Telemachus smiled to his father,</p>
<p>but so that Eumaeus</p>
<p>could not see him.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>when they had finished their work and the meal was ready,</p>
<p>they</p>
<p>ate it,</p>
<p>and every man had his full share so that all were satisfied. As</p>
<p>soon as they had had enough to eat and drink,</p>
<p>they laid down to rest</p>
<p>and enjoyed the boon of sleep.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XVII</span>
<p>TELEMACHUS AND HIS MOTHER MEET‚ÄîULYSSES AND EUMAEUS COME DOWN TO THE</p>
<p>TOWN,</p>
<p>AND ULYSSES IS INSULTED BY MELANTHIUS‚ÄîHE IS RECOGNISED BY THE DOG</p>
<p>ARGOS‚ÄîHE IS INSULTED AND PRESENTLY STRUCK BY ANTINOUS WITH A</p>
<p>STOOL‚ÄîPENELOPE DESIRES THAT HE SHALL BE SENT TO HER.</p>
<p>When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>Telemachus</p>
<p>bound on his sandals and took a strong spear that suited his hands,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he wanted to go into the city. ‚ÄúOld friend,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he to the swineherd,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will now go to the town and show myself to my mother,</p>
<p>for she will</p>
<p>never leave off grieving till she has seen me. As for this unfortunate</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>take him to the town and let him beg there of any one who</p>
<p>will give him a drink and a piece of bread. I have trouble enough of my</p>
<p>own,</p>
<p>and cannot be burdened with other people. If this makes him angry</p>
<p>so much the worse for him,</p>
<p>but I like to say what I mean.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>I do not want to stay here; a beggar can</p>
<p>always do better in town than country,</p>
<p>for any one who likes can give</p>
<p>him something. I am too old to care about remaining here at the beck</p>
<p>and call of a master. Therefore let this man do as you have just told</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>and take me to the town as soon as I have had a warm by the fire,</p>
<p>and the day has got a little heat in it. My clothes are wretchedly</p>
<p>thin,</p>
<p>and this frosty morning I shall be perished with cold,</p>
<p>for you</p>
<p>say the city is some way off.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Telemachus strode off through the yards,</p>
<p>brooding his revenge</p>
<p>upon the suitors. When he reached home he stood his spear against a</p>
<p>bearing-post of the cloister,</p>
<p>crossed the stone floor of the cloister</p>
<p>itself,</p>
<p>and went inside.</p>
<p>Nurse Euryclea saw him long before any one else did. She was putting</p>
<p>the fleeces on to the seats,</p>
<p>and she burst out crying as she ran up to</p>
<p>him; all the other maids came up too,</p>
<p>and covered his head and</p>
<p>shoulders with their kisses. Penelope came out of her room looking like</p>
<p>Diana or Venus,</p>
<p>and wept as she flung her arms about her son. She</p>
<p>kissed his forehead and both his beautiful eyes,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLight of my eyes,</p>
<p>‚Äù</p>
<p>she cried as she spoke fondly to him,</p>
<p>‚Äúso you are come home again; I</p>
<p>made sure I was never going to see you any more. To think of your</p>
<p>having gone off to Pylos without saying anything about it or obtaining</p>
<p>my consent. But come,</p>
<p>tell me what you saw.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not scold me,</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúnor vex me,</p>
<p>seeing</p>
<p>what a narrow escape I have had,</p>
<p>but wash your face,</p>
<p>change your dress,</p>
<p>go upstairs with your maids,</p>
<p>and promise full and sufficient hecatombs</p>
<p>to all the gods if Jove will only grant us our revenge upon the</p>
<p>suitors. I must now go to the place of assembly to invite a stranger</p>
<p>who has come back with me from Pylos. I sent him on with my crew,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>told Piraeus to take him home and look after him till I could come for</p>
<p>him myself.‚Äù</p>
<p>She heeded her son‚Äôs words,</p>
<p>washed her face,</p>
<p>changed her dress,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>vowed full and sufficient hecatombs to all the gods if they would only</p>
<p>vouchsafe her revenge upon the suitors.</p>
<p>Telemachus went through,</p>
<p>and out of,</p>
<p>the cloisters spear in hand‚Äînot</p>
<p>alone,</p>
<p>for his two fleet dogs went with him. Minerva endowed him with a</p>
<p>presence of such divine comeliness that all marvelled at him as he went</p>
<p>by,</p>
<p>and the suitors gathered round him with fair words in their mouths</p>
<p>and malice in their hearts; but he avoided them,</p>
<p>and went to sit with</p>
<p>Mentor,</p>
<p>Antiphus,</p>
<p>and Halitherses,</p>
<p>old friends of his father‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>and they made him tell them all that had happened to him. Then Piraeus</p>
<p>came up with Theoclymenus,</p>
<p>whom he had escorted through the town to the</p>
<p>place of assembly,</p>
<p>whereon Telemachus at once joined them. Piraeus was</p>
<p>first to speak: ‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish you would send some of</p>
<p>your women to my house to take away the presents Menelaus gave you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not know,</p>
<p>Piraeus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat may happen. If</p>
<p>the suitors kill me in my own house and divide my property among them,</p>
<p>I would rather you had the presents than that any of those people</p>
<p>should get hold of them. If on the other hand I managed to kill them,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>shall be much obliged if you will kindly bring me my presents.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he took Theoclymenus to his own house. When they got</p>
<p>there they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats,</p>
<p>went into the</p>
<p>baths,</p>
<p>and washed themselves. When the maids had washed and anointed</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>and had given them cloaks and shirts,</p>
<p>they took their seats at</p>
<p>table. A maid servant then brought them water in a beautiful golden</p>
<p>ewer,</p>
<p>and poured it into a silver basin for them to wash their hands;</p>
<p>and she drew a clean table beside them. An upper servant brought them</p>
<p>bread and offered them many good things of what there was in the house.</p>
<p>Opposite them sat Penelope,</p>
<p>reclining on a couch by one of the</p>
<p>bearing-posts of the cloister,</p>
<p>and spinning. Then they laid their hands</p>
<p>on the good things that were before them,</p>
<p>and as soon as they had had</p>
<p>enough to eat and drink Penelope said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>I shall go upstairs and lie down on that sad couch,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>I have not ceased to water with my tears,</p>
<p>from the day Ulysses set out</p>
<p>for Troy with the sons of Atreus. You failed,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>to make it clear</p>
<p>to me before the suitors came back to the house,</p>
<p>whether or no you had</p>
<p>been able to hear anything about the return of your father.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you then truth,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied her son. ‚ÄúWe went to Pylos and</p>
<p>saw Nestor,</p>
<p>who took me to his house and treated me as hospitably as</p>
<p>though I were a son of his own who had just returned after a long</p>
<p>absence; so also did his sons; but he said he had not heard a word from</p>
<p>any human being about Ulysses,</p>
<p>whether he was alive or dead. He sent</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>with a chariot and horses to Menelaus. There I saw</p>
<p>Helen,</p>
<p>for whose sake so many,</p>
<p>both Argives and Trojans,</p>
<p>were in</p>
<p>heaven‚Äôs wisdom doomed to suffer. Menelaus asked me what it was that</p>
<p>had brought me to Lacedaemon,</p>
<p>and I told him the whole truth,</p>
<p>whereon</p>
<p>he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSo,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>these cowards would usurp a brave man‚Äôs bed? A hind</p>
<p>might as well lay her new-born young in the lair of a lion,</p>
<p>and then go</p>
<p>off to feed in the forest or in some grassy dell. The lion,</p>
<p>when he</p>
<p>comes back to his lair,</p>
<p>will make short work with the pair of them,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>so will Ulysses with these suitors. By father Jove,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Apollo,</p>
<p>if Ulysses is still the man that he was when he wrestled with</p>
<p>Philomeleides in Lesbos,</p>
<p>and threw him so heavily that all the Greeks</p>
<p>cheered him‚Äîif he is still such,</p>
<p>and were to come near these suitors,</p>
<p>they would have a short shrift and a sorry wedding. As regards your</p>
<p>question,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>I will not prevaricate nor deceive you,</p>
<p>but what the</p>
<p>old man of the sea told me,</p>
<p>so much will I tell you in full. He said he</p>
<p>could see Ulysses on an island sorrowing bitterly in the house of the</p>
<p>nymph Calypso,</p>
<p>who was keeping him prisoner,</p>
<p>and he could not reach his</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>for he had no ships nor sailors to take him over the sea.‚Äô This</p>
<p>was what Menelaus told me,</p>
<p>and when I had heard his story I came away;</p>
<p>the gods then gave me a fair wind and soon brought me safe home again.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he moved the heart of Penelope. Then Theoclymenus said</p>
<p>to her:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>wife of Ulysses,</p>
<p>Telemachus does not understand these things;</p>
<p>listen therefore to me,</p>
<p>for I can divine them surely,</p>
<p>and will hide</p>
<p>nothing from you. May Jove the king of heaven be my witness,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>rites of hospitality,</p>
<p>with that hearth of Ulysses to which I now come,</p>
<p>that Ulysses himself is even now in Ithaca,</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p>either going about the</p>
<p>country or staying in one place,</p>
<p>is enquiring into all these evil deeds</p>
<p>and preparing a day of reckoning for the suitors. I saw an omen when I</p>
<p>was on the ship which meant this,</p>
<p>and I told Telemachus about it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay it be even so,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Penelope; ‚Äúif your words come true,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you</p>
<p>shall congratulate you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were throwing discs,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>aiming with spears at a mark on the levelled ground in front of the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and behaving with all their old insolence. But when it was now</p>
<p>time for dinner,</p>
<p>and the flock of sheep and goats had come into the</p>
<p>town from all the country round,</p>
<p>140 with their shepherds as usual,</p>
<p>then Medon,</p>
<p>who was their favourite servant,</p>
<p>and who waited upon them</p>
<p>at table,</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNow then,</p>
<p>my young masters,</p>
<p>you have had enough sport,</p>
<p>so come inside that we may get dinner ready. Dinner is not a bad thing,</p>
<p>at dinner time.‚Äù</p>
<p>They left their sports as he told them,</p>
<p>and when they were within the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>they laid their cloaks on the benches and seats inside,</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>sacrificed some sheep,</p>
<p>goats,</p>
<p>pigs,</p>
<p>and a heifer,</p>
<p>all of them fat and</p>
<p>well grown.141 Thus they made ready for their meal. In the meantime</p>
<p>Ulysses and the swineherd were about starting for the town,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>swineherd said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>I suppose you still want to go to town</p>
<p>to-day,</p>
<p>as my master said you were to do; for my own part I should have</p>
<p>liked you to stay here as a station hand,</p>
<p>but I must do as my master</p>
<p>tells me,</p>
<p>or he will scold me later on,</p>
<p>and a scolding from one‚Äôs</p>
<p>master is a very serious thing. Let us then be off,</p>
<p>for it is now broad</p>
<p>day; it will be night again directly and then you will find it</p>
<p>colder.‚Äù142</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know,</p>
<p>and understand you,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses; ‚Äúyou need say no more.</p>
<p>Let us be going,</p>
<p>but if you have a stick ready cut,</p>
<p>let me have it to</p>
<p>walk with,</p>
<p>for you say the road is a very rough one.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he threw his shabby old tattered wallet over his shoulders,</p>
<p>by the cord from which it hung,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus gave him a stick to his</p>
<p>liking. The two then started,</p>
<p>leaving the station in charge of the dogs</p>
<p>and herdsmen who remained behind; the swineherd led the way and his</p>
<p>master followed after,</p>
<p>looking like some broken down old tramp as he</p>
<p>leaned upon his staff,</p>
<p>and his clothes were all in rags. When they had</p>
<p>got over the rough steep ground and were nearing the city,</p>
<p>they reached</p>
<p>the fountain from which the citizens drew their water. This had been</p>
<p>made by Ithacus,</p>
<p>Neritus,</p>
<p>and Polyctor. There was a grove of</p>
<p>water-loving poplars planted in a circle all round it,</p>
<p>and the clear</p>
<p>cold water came down to it from a rock high up,</p>
<p>143 while above the</p>
<p>fountain there was an altar to the nymphs,</p>
<p>at which all wayfarers used</p>
<p>to sacrifice. Here Melanthius son of Dolius overtook them as he was</p>
<p>driving down some goats,</p>
<p>the best in his flock,</p>
<p>for the suitors‚Äô</p>
<p>dinner,</p>
<p>and there were two shepherds with him. When he saw Eumaeus and</p>
<p>Ulysses he reviled them with outrageous and unseemly language,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>made Ulysses very angry.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThere you go,</p>
<p>‚Äù cried he,</p>
<p>‚Äúand a precious pair you are. See how heaven</p>
<p>brings birds of the same feather to one another. Where,</p>
<p>pray,</p>
<p>master</p>
<p>swineherd,</p>
<p>are you taking this poor miserable object? It would make any</p>
<p>one sick to see such a creature at table. A fellow like this never won</p>
<p>a prize for anything in his life,</p>
<p>but will go about rubbing his</p>
<p>shoulders against every man‚Äôs door post,</p>
<p>and begging,</p>
<p>not for swords</p>
<p>and cauldrons144 like a man,</p>
<p>but only for a few scraps not worth</p>
<p>begging for. If you would give him to me for a hand on my station,</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>might do to clean out the folds,</p>
<p>or bring a bit of sweet feed to the</p>
<p>kids,</p>
<p>and he could fatten his thighs as much as he pleased on whey; but</p>
<p>he has taken to bad ways and will not go about any kind of work; he</p>
<p>will do nothing but beg victuals all the town over,</p>
<p>to feed his</p>
<p>insatiable belly. I say,</p>
<p>therefore‚Äîand it shall surely be‚Äîif he goes</p>
<p>near Ulysses‚Äô house he will get his head broken by the stools they will</p>
<p>fling at him,</p>
<p>till they turn him out.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this,</p>
<p>as he passed,</p>
<p>he gave Ulysses a kick on the hip out of pure</p>
<p>wantonness,</p>
<p>but Ulysses stood firm,</p>
<p>and did not budge from the path.</p>
<p>For a moment he doubted whether or no to fly at Melanthius and kill him</p>
<p>with his staff,</p>
<p>or fling him to the ground and beat his brains out; he</p>
<p>resolved,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>to endure it and keep himself in check,</p>
<p>but the</p>
<p>swineherd looked straight at Melanthius and rebuked him,</p>
<p>lifting up his</p>
<p>hands and praying to heaven as he did so.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFountain nymphs,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúchildren of Jove,</p>
<p>if ever Ulysses burned</p>
<p>you thigh bones covered with fat whether of lambs or kids,</p>
<p>grant my</p>
<p>prayer that heaven may send him home. He would soon put an end to the</p>
<p>swaggering threats with which such men as you go about insulting</p>
<p>people‚Äîgadding all over the town while your flocks are going to ruin</p>
<p>through bad shepherding.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Melanthius the goatherd answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou ill conditioned cur,</p>
<p>what</p>
<p>are you talking about? Some day or other I will put you on board ship</p>
<p>and take you to a foreign country,</p>
<p>where I can sell you and pocket the</p>
<p>money you will fetch. I wish I were as sure that Apollo would strike</p>
<p>Telemachus dead this very day,</p>
<p>or that the suitors would kill him,</p>
<p>as I</p>
<p>am that Ulysses will never come home again.‚Äù</p>
<p>With this he left them to come on at their leisure,</p>
<p>while he went</p>
<p>quickly forward and soon reached the house of his master. When he got</p>
<p>there he went in and took his seat among the suitors opposite</p>
<p>Eurymachus,</p>
<p>who liked him better than any of the others. The servants</p>
<p>brought him a portion of meat,</p>
<p>and an upper woman servant set bread</p>
<p>before him that he might eat. Presently Ulysses and the swineherd came</p>
<p>up to the house and stood by it,</p>
<p>amid a sound of music,</p>
<p>for Phemius was</p>
<p>just beginning to sing to the suitors. Then Ulysses took hold of the</p>
<p>swineherd‚Äôs hand,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>this house of Ulysses is a very fine place. No matter how far</p>
<p>you go,</p>
<p>you will find few like it. One building keeps following on</p>
<p>after another. The outer court has a wall with battlements all round</p>
<p>it; the doors are double folding,</p>
<p>and of good workmanship; it would be</p>
<p>a hard matter to take it by force of arms. I perceive,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>that there</p>
<p>are many people banqueting within it,</p>
<p>for there is a smell of roast</p>
<p>meat,</p>
<p>and I hear a sound of music,</p>
<p>which the gods have made to go along</p>
<p>with feasting.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Eumaeus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou have perceived aright,</p>
<p>as indeed you generally</p>
<p>do; but let us think what will be our best course. Will you go inside</p>
<p>first and join the suitors,</p>
<p>leaving me here behind you,</p>
<p>or will you</p>
<p>wait here and let me go in first? But do not wait long,</p>
<p>or some one may</p>
<p>see you loitering about outside,</p>
<p>and throw something at you. Consider</p>
<p>this matter I pray you.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand and heed. Go in first and leave me</p>
<p>here where I am. I am quite used to being beaten and having things</p>
<p>thrown at me. I have been so much buffeted about in war and by sea that</p>
<p>I am case-hardened,</p>
<p>and this too may go with the rest. But a man cannot</p>
<p>hide away the cravings of a hungry belly; this is an enemy which gives</p>
<p>much trouble to all men; it is because of this that ships are fitted</p>
<p>out to sail the seas,</p>
<p>and to make war upon other people.‚Äù</p>
<p>As they were thus talking,</p>
<p>a dog that had been lying asleep raised his</p>
<p>head and pricked up his ears. This was Argos,</p>
<p>whom Ulysses had bred</p>
<p>before setting out for Troy,</p>
<p>but he had never had any work out of him.</p>
<p>In the old days he used to be taken out by the young men when they went</p>
<p>hunting wild goats,</p>
<p>or deer,</p>
<p>or hares,</p>
<p>but now that his master was gone</p>
<p>he was lying neglected on the heaps of mule and cow dung that lay in</p>
<p>front of the stable doors till the men should come and draw it away to</p>
<p>manure the great close; and he was full of fleas. As soon as he saw</p>
<p>Ulysses standing there,</p>
<p>he dropped his ears and wagged his tail,</p>
<p>but he</p>
<p>could not get close up to his master. When Ulysses saw the dog on the</p>
<p>other side of the yard,</p>
<p>he dashed a tear from his eyes without Eumaeus</p>
<p>seeing it,</p>
<p>and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>what a noble hound that is over yonder on the manure heap:</p>
<p>his build is splendid; is he as fine a fellow as he looks,</p>
<p>or is he</p>
<p>only one of those dogs that come begging about a table,</p>
<p>and are kept</p>
<p>merely for show?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis hound,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚Äúbelonged to him who has died in a far</p>
<p>country. If he were what he was when Ulysses left for Troy,</p>
<p>he would</p>
<p>soon show you what he could do. There was not a wild beast in the</p>
<p>forest that could get away from him when he was once on its tracks. But</p>
<p>now he has fallen on evil times,</p>
<p>for his master is dead and gone,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the women take no care of him. Servants never do their work when their</p>
<p>master‚Äôs hand is no longer over them,</p>
<p>for Jove takes half the goodness</p>
<p>out of a man when he makes a slave of him.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he went inside the buildings to the cloister where the</p>
<p>suitors were,</p>
<p>but Argos died as soon as he had recognised his master.</p>
<p>Telemachus saw Eumaeus long before any one else did,</p>
<p>and beckoned him</p>
<p>to come and sit beside him; so he looked about and saw a seat lying</p>
<p>near where the carver sat serving out their portions to the suitors; he</p>
<p>picked it up,</p>
<p>brought it to Telemachus‚Äôs table,</p>
<p>and sat down opposite</p>
<p>him. Then the servant brought him his portion,</p>
<p>and gave him bread from</p>
<p>the bread-basket.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards Ulysses came inside,</p>
<p>looking like a poor</p>
<p>miserable old beggar,</p>
<p>leaning on his staff and with his clothes all in</p>
<p>rags. He sat down upon the threshold of ash-wood just inside the doors</p>
<p>leading from the outer to the inner court,</p>
<p>and against a bearing-post</p>
<p>of cypress-wood which the carpenter had skilfully planed,</p>
<p>and had made</p>
<p>to join truly with rule and line. Telemachus took a whole loaf from the</p>
<p>bread-basket,</p>
<p>with as much meat as he could hold in his two hands,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>said to Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake this to the stranger,</p>
<p>and tell him to go the</p>
<p>round of the suitors,</p>
<p>and beg from them; a beggar must not be</p>
<p>shamefaced.‚Äù</p>
<p>So Eumaeus went up to him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>Telemachus sends you</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>and says you are to go the round of the suitors begging,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>beggars must not be shamefaced.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay King Jove grant all happiness to Telemachus,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>fulfil the desire of his heart.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then with both hands he took what Telemachus had sent him,</p>
<p>and laid it</p>
<p>on the dirty old wallet at his feet. He went on eating it while the</p>
<p>bard was singing,</p>
<p>and had just finished his dinner as he left off. The</p>
<p>suitors applauded the bard,</p>
<p>whereon Minerva went up to Ulysses and</p>
<p>prompted him to beg pieces of bread from each one of the suitors,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>he might see what kind of people they were,</p>
<p>and tell the good from the</p>
<p>bad; but come what might she was not going to save a single one of</p>
<p>them. Ulysses,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>went on his round,</p>
<p>going from left to right,</p>
<p>and stretched out his hands to beg as though he were a real beggar.</p>
<p>Some of them pitied him,</p>
<p>and were curious about him,</p>
<p>asking one another</p>
<p>who he was and where he came from; whereon the goatherd Melanthius</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuitors of my noble mistress,</p>
<p>I can tell you something about</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>for I have seen him before. The swineherd brought him here,</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>know nothing about the man himself,</p>
<p>nor where he comes from.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Antinous began to abuse the swineherd. ‚ÄúYou precious idiot,</p>
<p>‚Äù he</p>
<p>cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat have you brought this man to town for? Have we not tramps</p>
<p>and beggars enough already to pester us as we sit at meat? Do you think</p>
<p>it a small thing that such people gather here to waste your master‚Äôs</p>
<p>property‚Äîand must you needs bring this man as well?‚Äù</p>
<p>And Eumaeus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>your birth is good but your words</p>
<p>evil. It was no doing of mine that he came here. Who is likely to</p>
<p>invite a stranger from a foreign country,</p>
<p>unless it be one of those who</p>
<p>can do public service as a seer,</p>
<p>a healer of hurts,</p>
<p>a carpenter,</p>
<p>or a</p>
<p>bard who can charm us with his singing? Such men are welcome all the</p>
<p>world over,</p>
<p>but no one is likely to ask a beggar who will only worry</p>
<p>him. You are always harder on Ulysses‚Äô servants than any of the other</p>
<p>suitors are,</p>
<p>and above all on me,</p>
<p>but I do not care so long as</p>
<p>Telemachus and Penelope are alive and here.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHush,</p>
<p>do not answer him; Antinous has the</p>
<p>bitterest tongue of all the suitors,</p>
<p>and he makes the others worse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then turning to Antinous he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>you take as much care of</p>
<p>my interests as though I were your son. Why should you want to see this</p>
<p>stranger turned out of the house? Heaven forbid; take something and</p>
<p>give it him yourself; I do not grudge it; I bid you take it. Never mind</p>
<p>my mother,</p>
<p>nor any of the other servants in the house; but I know you</p>
<p>will not do what I say,</p>
<p>for you are more fond of eating things yourself</p>
<p>than of giving them to other people.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat do you mean,</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Antinous,</p>
<p>‚Äúby this swaggering</p>
<p>talk? If all the suitors were to give him as much as I will,</p>
<p>he would</p>
<p>not come here again for another three months.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew the stool on which he rested his dainty feet from</p>
<p>under the table,</p>
<p>and made as though he would throw it at Ulysses,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the other suitors all gave him something,</p>
<p>and filled his wallet with</p>
<p>bread and meat; he was about,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>to go back to the threshold</p>
<p>and eat what the suitors had given him,</p>
<p>but he first went up to</p>
<p>Antinous and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>give me something; you are not,</p>
<p>surely,</p>
<p>the poorest man here; you</p>
<p>seem to be a chief,</p>
<p>foremost among them all; therefore you should be</p>
<p>the better giver,</p>
<p>and I will tell far and wide of your bounty. I too</p>
<p>was a rich man once,</p>
<p>and had a fine house of my own; in those days I</p>
<p>gave to many a tramp such as I now am,</p>
<p>no matter who he might be nor</p>
<p>what he wanted. I had any number of servants,</p>
<p>and all the other things</p>
<p>which people have who live well and are accounted wealthy,</p>
<p>but it</p>
<p>pleased Jove to take all away from me. He sent me with a band of roving</p>
<p>robbers to Egypt; it was a long voyage and I was undone by it. I</p>
<p>stationed my ships in the river Aegyptus,</p>
<p>and bade my men stay by them</p>
<p>and keep guard over them,</p>
<p>while I sent out scouts to reconnoitre from</p>
<p>every point of vantage.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut the men disobeyed my orders,</p>
<p>took to their own devices,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>ravaged the land of the Egyptians,</p>
<p>killing the men,</p>
<p>and taking their</p>
<p>wives and children captives. The alarm was soon carried to the city,</p>
<p>and when they heard the war-cry,</p>
<p>the people came out at daybreak till</p>
<p>the plain was filled with soldiers horse and foot,</p>
<p>and with the gleam</p>
<p>of armour. Then Jove spread panic among my men,</p>
<p>and they would no</p>
<p>longer face the enemy,</p>
<p>for they found themselves surrounded. The</p>
<p>Egyptians killed many of us,</p>
<p>and took the rest alive to do forced</p>
<p>labour for them; as for myself,</p>
<p>they gave me to a friend who met them,</p>
<p>to take to Cyprus,</p>
<p>Dmetor by name,</p>
<p>son of Iasus,</p>
<p>who was a great man in</p>
<p>Cyprus. Thence I am come hither in a state of great misery.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Antinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat god can have sent such a pestilence to plague</p>
<p>us during our dinner? Get out,</p>
<p>into the open part of the court,</p>
<p>145 or I</p>
<p>will give you Egypt and Cyprus over again for your insolence and</p>
<p>importunity; you have begged of all the others,</p>
<p>and they have given you</p>
<p>lavishly,</p>
<p>for they have abundance round them,</p>
<p>and it is easy to be free</p>
<p>with other people‚Äôs property when there is plenty of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Ulysses began to move off,</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour looks,</p>
<p>my fine sir,</p>
<p>are better than your breeding; if you were in your own house you would</p>
<p>not spare a poor man so much as a pinch of salt,</p>
<p>for though you are in</p>
<p>another man‚Äôs,</p>
<p>and surrounded with abundance,</p>
<p>you cannot find it in you</p>
<p>to give him even a piece of bread.‚Äù</p>
<p>This made Antinous very angry,</p>
<p>and he scowled at him saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou shall</p>
<p>pay for this before you get clear of the court.‚Äù With these words he</p>
<p>threw a footstool at him,</p>
<p>and hit him on the right shoulder blade near</p>
<p>the top of his back. Ulysses stood firm as a rock and the blow did not</p>
<p>even stagger him,</p>
<p>but he shook his head in silence as he brooded on his</p>
<p>revenge. Then he went back to the threshold and sat down there,</p>
<p>laying</p>
<p>his well filled wallet at his feet.</p>
<p>‚ÄúListen to me,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou suitors of Queen Penelope,</p>
<p>that I may</p>
<p>speak even as I am minded. A man knows neither ache nor pain if he gets</p>
<p>hit while fighting for his money,</p>
<p>or for his sheep or his cattle; and</p>
<p>even so Antinous has hit me while in the service of my miserable belly,</p>
<p>which is always getting people into trouble. Still,</p>
<p>if the poor have</p>
<p>gods and avenging deities at all,</p>
<p>I pray them that Antinous may come to</p>
<p>a bad end before his marriage.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSit where you are,</p>
<p>and eat your victuals in silence,</p>
<p>or be off</p>
<p>elsewhere,</p>
<p>‚Äù shouted Antinous. ‚ÄúIf you say more I will have you dragged</p>
<p>hand and foot through the courts,</p>
<p>and the servants shall flay you</p>
<p>alive.‚Äù</p>
<p>The other suitors were much displeased at this,</p>
<p>and one of the young</p>
<p>men said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>you did ill in striking that poor wretch of a</p>
<p>tramp: it will be worse for you if he should turn out to be some</p>
<p>god‚Äîand we know the gods go about disguised in all sorts of ways as</p>
<p>people from foreign countries,</p>
<p>and travel about the world to see who do</p>
<p>amiss and who righteously.‚Äù146</p>
<p>Thus said the suitors,</p>
<p>but Antinous paid them no heed. Meanwhile</p>
<p>Telemachus was furious about the blow that had been given to his</p>
<p>father,</p>
<p>and though no tear fell from him,</p>
<p>he shook his head in silence</p>
<p>and brooded on his revenge.</p>
<p>Now when Penelope heard that the beggar had been struck in the</p>
<p>banqueting-cloister,</p>
<p>she said before her maids,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWould that Apollo</p>
<p>would so strike you,</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>‚Äù and her waiting woman Eurynome</p>
<p>answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf our prayers were answered not one of the suitors would</p>
<p>ever again see the sun rise.‚Äù Then Penelope said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>147 I hate</p>
<p>every single one of them,</p>
<p>for they mean nothing but mischief,</p>
<p>but I</p>
<p>hate Antinous like the darkness of death itself. A poor unfortunate</p>
<p>tramp has come begging about the house for sheer want. Every one else</p>
<p>has given him something to put in his wallet,</p>
<p>but Antinous has hit him</p>
<p>on the right shoulder-blade with a footstool.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did she talk with her maids as she sat in her own room,</p>
<p>and in the</p>
<p>meantime Ulysses was getting his dinner. Then she called for the</p>
<p>swineherd and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEumaeus,</p>
<p>go and tell the stranger to come here,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>want to see him and ask him some questions. He seems to have travelled</p>
<p>much,</p>
<p>and he may have seen or heard something of my unhappy husband.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf these Achaeans,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>would only keep quiet,</p>
<p>you would be charmed with the history of his</p>
<p>adventures. I had him three days and three nights with me in my hut,</p>
<p>which was the first place he reached after running away from his ship,</p>
<p>and he has not yet completed the story of his misfortunes. If he had</p>
<p>been the most heaven-taught minstrel in the whole world,</p>
<p>on whose lips</p>
<p>all hearers hang entranced,</p>
<p>I could not have been more charmed as I sat</p>
<p>in my hut and listened to him. He says there is an old friendship</p>
<p>between his house and that of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and that he comes from Crete</p>
<p>where the descendants of Minos live,</p>
<p>after having been driven hither</p>
<p>and thither by every kind of misfortune; he also declares that he has</p>
<p>heard of Ulysses as being alive and near at hand among the</p>
<p>Thesprotians,</p>
<p>and that he is bringing great wealth home with him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall him here,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat I too may hear his story.</p>
<p>As for the suitors,</p>
<p>let them take their pleasure indoors or out as they</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>for they have nothing to fret about. Their corn and wine remain</p>
<p>unwasted in their houses with none but servants to consume them,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>they keep hanging about our house day after day sacrificing our oxen,</p>
<p>sheep,</p>
<p>and fat goats for their banquets,</p>
<p>and never giving so much as a</p>
<p>thought to the quantity of wine they drink. No estate can stand such</p>
<p>recklessness,</p>
<p>for we have now no Ulysses to protect us. If he were to</p>
<p>come again,</p>
<p>he and his son would soon have their revenge.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke Telemachus sneezed so loudly that the whole house</p>
<p>resounded with it. Penelope laughed when she heard this,</p>
<p>and said to</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo and call the stranger; did you not hear how my son sneezed</p>
<p>just as I was speaking? This can only mean that all the suitors are</p>
<p>going to be killed,</p>
<p>and that not one of them shall escape. Furthermore</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<p>and lay my saying to your heart: if I am satisfied that the</p>
<p>stranger is speaking the truth I shall give him a shirt and cloak of</p>
<p>good wear.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Eumaeus heard this he went straight to Ulysses and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>my mistress Penelope,</p>
<p>mother of Telemachus,</p>
<p>has sent for you;</p>
<p>she is in great grief,</p>
<p>but she wishes to hear anything you can tell her</p>
<p>about her husband,</p>
<p>and if she is satisfied that you are speaking the</p>
<p>truth,</p>
<p>she will give you a shirt and cloak,</p>
<p>which are the very things</p>
<p>that you are most in want of. As for bread,</p>
<p>you can get enough of that</p>
<p>to fill your belly,</p>
<p>by begging about the town,</p>
<p>and letting those give</p>
<p>that will.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúnothing but what is strictly</p>
<p>true. I know all about her husband,</p>
<p>and have been partner with him in</p>
<p>affliction,</p>
<p>but I am afraid of passing through this crowd of cruel</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>for their pride and insolence reach heaven. Just now,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>as I was going about the house without doing any harm,</p>
<p>a man</p>
<p>gave me a blow that hurt me very much,</p>
<p>but neither Telemachus nor any</p>
<p>one else defended me. Tell Penelope,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>to be patient and wait</p>
<p>till sundown. Let her give me a seat close up to the fire,</p>
<p>for my</p>
<p>clothes are worn very thin‚Äîyou know they are,</p>
<p>for you have seen them</p>
<p>ever since I first asked you to help me‚Äîshe can then ask me about the</p>
<p>return of her husband.‚Äù</p>
<p>The swineherd went back when he heard this,</p>
<p>and Penelope said as she</p>
<p>saw him cross the threshold,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhy do you not bring him here,</p>
<p>Eumaeus?</p>
<p>Is he afraid that some one will ill-treat him,</p>
<p>or is he shy of coming</p>
<p>inside the house at all? Beggars should not be shamefaced.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this you answered,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe stranger is quite</p>
<p>reasonable. He is avoiding the suitors,</p>
<p>and is only doing what any one</p>
<p>else would do. He asks you to wait till sundown,</p>
<p>and it will be much</p>
<p>better,</p>
<p>madam,</p>
<p>that you should have him all to yourself,</p>
<p>when you can</p>
<p>hear him and talk to him as you will.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe man is no fool,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúit would very likely be as he</p>
<p>says,</p>
<p>for there are no such abominable people in the whole world as</p>
<p>these men are.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she had done speaking Eumaeus went back to the suitors,</p>
<p>for he had</p>
<p>explained everything. Then he went up to Telemachus and said in his ear</p>
<p>so that none could overhear him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear sir,</p>
<p>I will now go back to</p>
<p>the pigs,</p>
<p>to see after your property and my own business. You will look</p>
<p>to what is going on here,</p>
<p>but above all be careful to keep out of</p>
<p>danger,</p>
<p>for there are many who bear you ill will. May Jove bring them</p>
<p>to a bad end before they do us a mischief.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVery well,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúgo home when you have had your</p>
<p>dinner,</p>
<p>and in the morning come here with the victims we are to</p>
<p>sacrifice for the day. Leave the rest to heaven and me.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Eumaeus took his seat again,</p>
<p>and when he had finished his</p>
<p>dinner he left the courts and the cloister with the men at table,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>went back to his pigs. As for the suitors,</p>
<p>they presently began to</p>
<p>amuse themselves with singing and dancing,</p>
<p>for it was now getting on</p>
<p>towards evening.</p>

<p>THE FIGHT WITH IRUS‚ÄîULYSSES WARNS AMPHINOMUS‚ÄîPENELOPE GETS PRESENTS</p>
<p>FROM THE SUITORS‚ÄîTHE BRAZIERS‚ÄîULYSSES REBUKES EURYMACHUS.</p>
<p>Now there came a certain common tramp who used to go begging all over</p>
<p>the city of Ithaca,</p>
<p>and was notorious as an incorrigible glutton and</p>
<p>drunkard. This man had no strength nor stay in him,</p>
<p>but he was a great</p>
<p>hulking fellow to look at; his real name,</p>
<p>the one his mother gave him,</p>
<p>was Arnaeus,</p>
<p>but the young men of the place called him Irus,</p>
<p>148 because</p>
<p>he used to run errands for any one who would send him. As soon as he</p>
<p>came he began to insult Ulysses,</p>
<p>and to try and drive him out of his</p>
<p>own house.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBe off,</p>
<p>old man,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúfrom the doorway,</p>
<p>or you shall be dragged</p>
<p>out neck and heels. Do you not see that they are all giving me the</p>
<p>wink,</p>
<p>and wanting me to turn you out by force,</p>
<p>only I do not like to do</p>
<p>so? Get up then,</p>
<p>and go of yourself,</p>
<p>or we shall come to blows.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses frowned on him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friend,</p>
<p>I do you no manner of</p>
<p>harm; people give you a great deal,</p>
<p>but I am not jealous. There is room</p>
<p>enough in this doorway for the pair of us,</p>
<p>and you need not grudge me</p>
<p>things that are not yours to give. You seem to be just such another</p>
<p>tramp as myself,</p>
<p>but perhaps the gods will give us better luck by and</p>
<p>by. Do not,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>talk too much about fighting or you will incense</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>and old though I am,</p>
<p>I shall cover your mouth and chest with blood.</p>
<p>I shall have more peace tomorrow if I do,</p>
<p>for you will not come to the</p>
<p>house of Ulysses any more.‚Äù</p>
<p>Irus was very angry and answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou filthy glutton,</p>
<p>you run on</p>
<p>trippingly like an old fish-fag. I have a good mind to lay both hands</p>
<p>about you,</p>
<p>and knock your teeth out of your head like so many boar‚Äôs</p>
<p>tusks. Get ready,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and let these people here stand by and</p>
<p>look on. You will never be able to fight one who is so much younger</p>
<p>than yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus roundly did they rate one another on the smooth pavement in front</p>
<p>of the doorway,</p>
<p>149 and when Antinous saw what was going on he laughed</p>
<p>heartily and said to the others,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is the finest sport that you</p>
<p>ever saw; heaven never yet sent anything like it into this house. The</p>
<p>stranger and Irus have quarreled and are going to fight,</p>
<p>let us set</p>
<p>them on to do so at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>The suitors all came up laughing,</p>
<p>and gathered round the two ragged</p>
<p>tramps. ‚ÄúListen to me,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Antinous,</p>
<p>‚Äúthere are some goats‚Äô paunches</p>
<p>down at the fire,</p>
<p>which we have filled with blood and fat,</p>
<p>and set</p>
<p>aside for supper; he who is victorious and proves himself to be the</p>
<p>better man shall have his pick of the lot; he shall be free of our</p>
<p>table and we will not allow any other beggar about the house at all.‚Äù</p>
<p>The others all agreed,</p>
<p>but Ulysses,</p>
<p>to throw them off the scent,</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSirs,</p>
<p>an old man like myself,</p>
<p>worn out with suffering,</p>
<p>cannot hold his</p>
<p>own against a young one; but my irrepressible belly urges me on,</p>
<p>though</p>
<p>I know it can only end in my getting a drubbing. You must swear,</p>
<p>however that none of you will give me a foul blow to favour Irus and</p>
<p>secure him the victory.‚Äù</p>
<p>They swore as he told them,</p>
<p>and when they had completed their oath</p>
<p>Telemachus put in a word and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>if you have a mind to</p>
<p>settle with this fellow,</p>
<p>you need not be afraid of any one here.</p>
<p>Whoever strikes you will have to fight more than one. I am host,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the other chiefs,</p>
<p>Antinous and Eurymachus,</p>
<p>both of them men of</p>
<p>understanding,</p>
<p>are of the same mind as I am.‚Äù</p>
<p>Every one assented,</p>
<p>and Ulysses girded his old rags about his loins,</p>
<p>thus baring his stalwart thighs,</p>
<p>his broad chest and shoulders,</p>
<p>and his</p>
<p>mighty arms; but Minerva came up to him and made his limbs even</p>
<p>stronger still. The suitors were beyond measure astonished,</p>
<p>and one</p>
<p>would turn towards his neighbour saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe stranger has brought such</p>
<p>a thigh out of his old rags that there will soon be nothing left of</p>
<p>Irus.‚Äù</p>
<p>Irus began to be very uneasy as he heard them,</p>
<p>but the servants girded</p>
<p>him by force,</p>
<p>and brought him [into the open part of the court] in such</p>
<p>a fright that his limbs were all of a tremble. Antinous scolded him and</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou swaggering bully,</p>
<p>you ought never to have been born at all</p>
<p>if you are afraid of such an old broken down creature as this tramp is.</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<p>therefore‚Äîand it shall surely be‚Äîif he beats you and proves</p>
<p>himself the better man,</p>
<p>I shall pack you off on board ship to the</p>
<p>mainland and send you to king Echetus,</p>
<p>who kills every one that comes</p>
<p>near him. He will cut off your nose and ears,</p>
<p>and draw out your</p>
<p>entrails for the dogs to eat.‚Äù</p>
<p>This frightened Irus still more,</p>
<p>but they brought him into the middle</p>
<p>of the court,</p>
<p>and the two men raised their hands to fight. Then Ulysses</p>
<p>considered whether he should let drive so hard at him as to make an end</p>
<p>of him then and there,</p>
<p>or whether he should give him a lighter blow</p>
<p>that should only knock him down; in the end he deemed it best to give</p>
<p>the lighter blow for fear the Achaeans should begin to suspect who he</p>
<p>was. Then they began to fight,</p>
<p>and Irus hit Ulysses on the right</p>
<p>shoulder; but Ulysses gave Irus a blow on the neck under the ear that</p>
<p>broke in the bones of his skull,</p>
<p>and the blood came gushing out of his</p>
<p>mouth; he fell groaning in the dust,</p>
<p>gnashing his teeth and kicking on</p>
<p>the ground,</p>
<p>but the suitors threw up their hands and nearly died of</p>
<p>laughter,</p>
<p>as Ulysses caught hold of him by the foot and dragged him</p>
<p>into the outer court as far as the gate-house. There he propped him up</p>
<p>against the wall and put his staff in his hands. ‚ÄúSit here,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúand keep the dogs and pigs off; you are a pitiful creature,</p>
<p>and if you</p>
<p>try to make yourself king of the beggars any more you shall fare still</p>
<p>worse.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he threw his dirty old wallet,</p>
<p>all tattered and torn over his</p>
<p>shoulder with the cord by which it hung,</p>
<p>and went back to sit down upon</p>
<p>the threshold; but the suitors went within the cloisters,</p>
<p>laughing and</p>
<p>saluting him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay Jove,</p>
<p>and all the other gods,</p>
<p>‚Äù said they,</p>
<p>‚Äúgrant you</p>
<p>whatever you want for having put an end to the importunity of this</p>
<p>insatiable tramp. We will take him over to the mainland presently,</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>king Echetus,</p>
<p>who kills every one that comes near him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses hailed this as of good omen,</p>
<p>and Antinous set a great goat‚Äôs</p>
<p>paunch before him filled with blood and fat. Amphinomus took two loaves</p>
<p>out of the bread-basket and brought them to him,</p>
<p>pledging him as he did</p>
<p>so in a golden goblet of wine. ‚ÄúGood luck to you,</p>
<p>‚Äù he said,</p>
<p>‚Äúfather</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>you are very badly off at present,</p>
<p>but I hope you will have</p>
<p>better times by and by.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmphinomus,</p>
<p>you seem to be a man of good</p>
<p>understanding,</p>
<p>as indeed you may well be,</p>
<p>seeing whose son you are. I</p>
<p>have heard your father well spoken of; he is Nisus of Dulichium,</p>
<p>a man</p>
<p>both brave and wealthy. They tell me you are his son,</p>
<p>and you appear to</p>
<p>be a considerable person; listen,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and take heed to what I am</p>
<p>saying. Man is the vainest of all creatures that have their being upon</p>
<p>earth. As long as heaven vouchsafes him health and strength,</p>
<p>he thinks</p>
<p>that he shall come to no harm hereafter,</p>
<p>and even when the blessed gods</p>
<p>bring sorrow upon him,</p>
<p>he bears it as he needs must,</p>
<p>and makes the best</p>
<p>of it; for God almighty gives men their daily minds day by day. I know</p>
<p>all about it,</p>
<p>for I was a rich man once,</p>
<p>and did much wrong in the</p>
<p>stubbornness of my pride,</p>
<p>and in the confidence that my father and my</p>
<p>brothers would support me; therefore let a man fear God in all things</p>
<p>always,</p>
<p>and take the good that heaven may see fit to send him without</p>
<p>vain glory. Consider the infamy of what these suitors are doing; see</p>
<p>how they are wasting the estate,</p>
<p>and doing dishonour to the wife,</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>one who is certain to return some day,</p>
<p>and that,</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>not long hence.</p>
<p>Nay,</p>
<p>he will be here soon; may heaven send you home quietly first that</p>
<p>you may not meet with him in the day of his coming,</p>
<p>for once he is here</p>
<p>the suitors and he will not part bloodlessly.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he made a drink-offering,</p>
<p>and when he had drunk he put</p>
<p>the gold cup again into the hands of Amphinomus,</p>
<p>who walked away</p>
<p>serious and bowing his head,</p>
<p>for he foreboded evil. But even so he did</p>
<p>not escape destruction,</p>
<p>for Minerva had doomed him to fall by the hand</p>
<p>of Telemachus. So he took his seat again at the place from which he had</p>
<p>come.</p>
<p>Then Minerva put it into the mind of Penelope to show herself to the</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>that she might make them still more enamoured of her,</p>
<p>and win</p>
<p>still further honour from her son and husband. So she feigned a mocking</p>
<p>laugh and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurynome,</p>
<p>I have changed my mind,</p>
<p>and have a fancy to</p>
<p>show myself to the suitors although I detest them. I should like also</p>
<p>to give my son a hint that he had better not have anything more to do</p>
<p>with them. They speak fairly enough but they mean mischief.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear child,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Eurynome,</p>
<p>‚Äúall that you have said is true,</p>
<p>go</p>
<p>and tell your son about it,</p>
<p>but first wash yourself and anoint your</p>
<p>face. Do not go about with your cheeks all covered with tears; it is</p>
<p>not right that you should grieve so incessantly; for Telemachus,</p>
<p>whom</p>
<p>you always prayed that you might live to see with a beard,</p>
<p>is already</p>
<p>grown up.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI know,</p>
<p>Eurynome,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat you mean well,</p>
<p>but do not</p>
<p>try and persuade me to wash and to anoint myself,</p>
<p>for heaven robbed me</p>
<p>of all my beauty on the day my husband sailed; nevertheless,</p>
<p>tell</p>
<p>Autonoe and Hippodamia that I want them. They must be with me when I am</p>
<p>in the cloister; I am not going among the men alone; it would not be</p>
<p>proper for me to do so.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the old woman150 went out of the room to bid the maids go to</p>
<p>their mistress. In the meantime Minerva bethought her of another</p>
<p>matter,</p>
<p>and sent Penelope off into a sweet slumber; so she lay down on</p>
<p>her couch and her limbs became heavy with sleep. Then the goddess shed</p>
<p>grace and beauty over her that all the Achaeans might admire her. She</p>
<p>washed her face with the ambrosial loveliness that Venus wears when she</p>
<p>goes dancing with the Graces; she made her taller and of a more</p>
<p>commanding figure,</p>
<p>while as for her complexion it was whiter than sawn</p>
<p>ivory. When Minerva had done all this she went away,</p>
<p>whereon the maids</p>
<p>came in from the women‚Äôs room and woke Penelope with the sound of their</p>
<p>talking.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWhat an exquisitely delicious sleep I have been having,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>she passed her hands over her face,</p>
<p>‚Äúin spite of all my misery. I wish</p>
<p>Diana would let me die so sweetly now at this very moment,</p>
<p>that I might</p>
<p>no longer waste in despair for the loss of my dear husband,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>possessed every kind of good quality and was the most distinguished man</p>
<p>among the Achaeans.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words she came down from her upper room,</p>
<p>not alone but</p>
<p>attended by two of her maidens,</p>
<p>and when she reached the suitors she</p>
<p>stood by one of the bearing-posts supporting the roof of the cloister,</p>
<p>holding a veil before her face,</p>
<p>and with a staid maid servant on either</p>
<p>side of her. As they beheld her the suitors were so overpowered and</p>
<p>became so desperately enamoured of her,</p>
<p>that each one prayed he might</p>
<p>win her for his own bed fellow.</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>addressing her son,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI fear you are no longer</p>
<p>so discreet and well conducted as you used to be. When you were younger</p>
<p>you had a greater sense of propriety; now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that you are grown</p>
<p>up,</p>
<p>though a stranger to look at you would take you for the son of a</p>
<p>well to do father as far as size and good looks go,</p>
<p>your conduct is by</p>
<p>no means what it should be. What is all this disturbance that has been</p>
<p>going on,</p>
<p>and how came you to allow a stranger to be so disgracefully</p>
<p>ill-treated? What would have happened if he had suffered serious injury</p>
<p>while a suppliant in our house? Surely this would have been very</p>
<p>discreditable to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not surprised,</p>
<p>my dear mother,</p>
<p>at your displeasure,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI understand all about it and know when things are not as</p>
<p>they should be,</p>
<p>which I could not do when I was younger; I cannot,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>behave with perfect propriety at all times. First one and then</p>
<p>another of these wicked people here keeps driving me out of my mind,</p>
<p>and I have no one to stand by me. After all,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>this fight</p>
<p>between Irus and the stranger did not turn out as the suitors meant it</p>
<p>to do,</p>
<p>for the stranger got the best of it. I wish Father Jove,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and Apollo would break the neck of every one of these wooers</p>
<p>of yours,</p>
<p>some inside the house and some out; and I wish they might all</p>
<p>be as limp as Irus is over yonder in the gate of the outer court. See</p>
<p>how he nods his head like a drunken man; he has had such a thrashing</p>
<p>that he cannot stand on his feet nor get back to his home,</p>
<p>wherever</p>
<p>that may be,</p>
<p>for he has no strength left in him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Eurymachus then came up and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúQueen</p>
<p>Penelope,</p>
<p>daughter of Icarius,</p>
<p>if all the Achaeans in Iasian Argos</p>
<p>could see you at this moment,</p>
<p>you would have still more suitors in your</p>
<p>house by tomorrow morning,</p>
<p>for you are the most admirable woman in the</p>
<p>whole world both as regards personal beauty and strength of</p>
<p>understanding.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Penelope replied,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurymachus,</p>
<p>heaven robbed me of all my</p>
<p>beauty whether of face or figure when the Argives set sail for Troy and</p>
<p>my dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my</p>
<p>affairs,</p>
<p>I should both be more respected and show a better presence to</p>
<p>the world. As it is,</p>
<p>I am oppressed with care,</p>
<p>and with the afflictions</p>
<p>which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. My husband foresaw it all,</p>
<p>and when he was leaving home he took my right wrist in his hand‚Äî‚ÄòWife,</p>
<p>‚Äô</p>
<p>he said,</p>
<p>‚Äòwe shall not all of us come safe home from Troy,</p>
<p>for the</p>
<p>Trojans fight well both with bow and spear. They are excellent also at</p>
<p>fighting from chariots,</p>
<p>and nothing decides the issue of a fight sooner</p>
<p>than this. I know not,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>whether heaven will send me back to</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>or whether I may not fall over there at Troy. In the meantime do</p>
<p>you look after things here. Take care of my father and mother as at</p>
<p>present,</p>
<p>and even more so during my absence,</p>
<p>but when you see our son</p>
<p>growing a beard,</p>
<p>then marry whom you will,</p>
<p>and leave this your present</p>
<p>home.‚Äô This is what he said and now it is all coming true. A night will</p>
<p>come when I shall have to yield myself to a marriage which I detest,</p>
<p>for Jove has taken from me all hope of happiness. This further grief,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>cuts me to the very heart. You suitors are not wooing me</p>
<p>after the custom of my country. When men are courting a woman who they</p>
<p>think will be a good wife to them and who is of noble birth,</p>
<p>and when</p>
<p>they are each trying to win her for himself,</p>
<p>they usually bring oxen</p>
<p>and sheep to feast the friends of the lady,</p>
<p>and they make her</p>
<p>magnificent presents,</p>
<p>instead of eating up other people‚Äôs property</p>
<p>without paying for it.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was what she said,</p>
<p>and Ulysses was glad when he heard her trying</p>
<p>to get presents out of the suitors,</p>
<p>and flattering them with fair words</p>
<p>which he knew she did not mean.</p>
<p>Then Antinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúQueen Penelope,</p>
<p>daughter of Icarius,</p>
<p>take as many</p>
<p>presents as you please from any one who will give them to you; it is</p>
<p>not well to refuse a present; but we will not go about our business nor</p>
<p>stir from where we are,</p>
<p>till you have married the best man among us</p>
<p>whoever he may be.‚Äù</p>
<p>The others applauded what Antinous had said,</p>
<p>and each one sent his</p>
<p>servant to bring his present. Antinous‚Äôs man returned with a large and</p>
<p>lovely dress most exquisitely embroidered. It had twelve beautifully</p>
<p>made brooch pins of pure gold with which to fasten it. Eurymachus</p>
<p>immediately brought her a magnificent chain of gold and amber beads</p>
<p>that gleamed like sunlight. Eurydamas‚Äôs two men returned with some</p>
<p>earrings fashioned into three brilliant pendants which glistened most</p>
<p>beautifully; while king Pisander son of Polyctor gave her a necklace of</p>
<p>the rarest workmanship,</p>
<p>and every one else brought her a beautiful</p>
<p>present of some kind.</p>
<p>Then the queen went back to her room upstairs,</p>
<p>and her maids brought</p>
<p>the presents after her. Meanwhile the suitors took to singing and</p>
<p>dancing,</p>
<p>and stayed till evening came. They danced and sang till it</p>
<p>grew dark; they then brought in three braziers151 to give light,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>piled them up with chopped firewood very old and dry,</p>
<p>and they lit</p>
<p>torches from them,</p>
<p>which the maids held up turn and turn about. Then</p>
<p>Ulysses said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMaids,</p>
<p>servants of Ulysses who has so long been absent,</p>
<p>go to the</p>
<p>queen inside the house; sit with her and amuse her,</p>
<p>or spin,</p>
<p>and pick</p>
<p>wool. I will hold the light for all these people. They may stay till</p>
<p>morning,</p>
<p>but shall not beat me,</p>
<p>for I can stand a great deal.‚Äù</p>
<p>The maids looked at one another and laughed,</p>
<p>while pretty Melantho</p>
<p>began to gibe at him contemptuously. She was daughter to Dolius,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>had been brought up by Penelope,</p>
<p>who used to give her toys to play</p>
<p>with,</p>
<p>and looked after her when she was a child; but in spite of all</p>
<p>this she showed no consideration for the sorrows of her mistress,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>used to misconduct herself with Eurymachus,</p>
<p>with whom she was in love.</p>
<p>‚ÄúPoor wretch,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúare you gone clean out of your mind? Go and</p>
<p>sleep in some smithy,</p>
<p>or place of public gossips,</p>
<p>instead of chattering</p>
<p>here. Are you not ashamed of opening your mouth before your betters‚Äîso</p>
<p>many of them too? Has the wine been getting into your head,</p>
<p>or do you</p>
<p>always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you</p>
<p>beat the tramp Irus; take care that a better man than he does not come</p>
<p>and cudgel you about the head till he pack you bleeding out of the</p>
<p>house.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúVixen,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses,</p>
<p>scowling at her,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will go and tell</p>
<p>Telemachus what you have been saying,</p>
<p>and he will have you torn limb</p>
<p>from limb.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he scared the women,</p>
<p>and they went off into the body</p>
<p>of the house. They trembled all over,</p>
<p>for they thought he would do as</p>
<p>he said. But Ulysses took his stand near the burning braziers,</p>
<p>holding</p>
<p>up torches and looking at the people‚Äîbrooding the while on things that</p>
<p>should surely come to pass.</p>
<p>But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment cease their</p>
<p>insolence,</p>
<p>for she wanted Ulysses to become even more bitter against</p>
<p>them; she therefore set Eurymachus son of Polybus on to gibe at him,</p>
<p>which made the others laugh. ‚ÄúListen to me,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou suitors of</p>
<p>Queen Penelope,</p>
<p>that I may speak even as I am minded. It is not for</p>
<p>nothing that this man has come to the house of Ulysses; I believe the</p>
<p>light has not been coming from the torches,</p>
<p>but from his own head‚Äîfor</p>
<p>his hair is all gone,</p>
<p>every bit of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then turning to Ulysses he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>will you work as a servant,</p>
<p>if I send you to the wolds and see that you are well paid? Can you</p>
<p>build a stone fence,</p>
<p>or plant trees? I will have you fed all the year</p>
<p>round,</p>
<p>and will find you in shoes and clothing. Will you go,</p>
<p>then? Not</p>
<p>you; for you have got into bad ways,</p>
<p>and do not want to work; you had</p>
<p>rather fill your belly by going round the country begging.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurymachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúif you and I were to work one against</p>
<p>the other in early summer when the days are at their longest‚Äîgive me a</p>
<p>good scythe,</p>
<p>and take another yourself,</p>
<p>and let us see which will last</p>
<p>the longer or mow the stronger,</p>
<p>from dawn till dark when the mowing</p>
<p>grass is about. Or if you will plough against me,</p>
<p>let us each take a</p>
<p>yoke of tawny oxen,</p>
<p>well-mated and of great strength and endurance:</p>
<p>turn me into a four acre field,</p>
<p>and see whether you or I can drive the</p>
<p>straighter furrow. If,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>war were to break out this day,</p>
<p>give me a</p>
<p>shield,</p>
<p>a couple of spears and a helmet fitting well upon my</p>
<p>temples‚Äîyou would find me foremost in the fray,</p>
<p>and would cease your</p>
<p>gibes about my belly. You are insolent and cruel,</p>
<p>and think yourself a</p>
<p>great man because you live in a little world,</p>
<p>and that a bad one. If</p>
<p>Ulysses comes to his own again,</p>
<p>the doors of his house are wide,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>you will find them narrow when you try to fly through them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eurymachus was furious at all this. He scowled at him and cried,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou</p>
<p>wretch,</p>
<p>I will soon pay you out for daring to say such things to me,</p>
<p>and in public too. Has the wine been getting into your head or do you</p>
<p>always babble in this way? You seem to have lost your wits because you</p>
<p>beat the tramp Irus.‚Äù With this he caught hold of a footstool,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>Ulysses sought protection at the knees of Amphinomus of Dulichium,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he was afraid. The stool hit the cupbearer on his right hand and</p>
<p>knocked him down: the man fell with a cry flat on his back,</p>
<p>and his</p>
<p>wine-jug fell ringing to the ground. The suitors in the covered</p>
<p>cloister were now in an uproar,</p>
<p>and one would turn towards his</p>
<p>neighbour,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish the stranger had gone somewhere else,</p>
<p>bad</p>
<p>luck to him,</p>
<p>for all the trouble he gives us. We cannot permit such</p>
<p>disturbance about a beggar; if such ill counsels are to prevail we</p>
<p>shall have no more pleasure at our banquet.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Telemachus came forward and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSirs,</p>
<p>are you mad? Can you</p>
<p>not carry your meat and your liquor decently? Some evil spirit has</p>
<p>possessed you. I do not wish to drive any of you away,</p>
<p>but you have had</p>
<p>your suppers,</p>
<p>and the sooner you all go home to bed the better.‚Äù</p>
<p>The suitors bit their lips and marvelled at the boldness of his speech;</p>
<p>but Amphinomus the son of Nisus,</p>
<p>who was son to Aretias,</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not</p>
<p>let us take offence; it is reasonable,</p>
<p>so let us make no answer.</p>
<p>Neither let us do violence to the stranger nor to any of Ulysses‚Äô</p>
<p>servants. Let the cupbearer go round with the drink-offerings,</p>
<p>that we</p>
<p>may make them and go home to our rest. As for the stranger,</p>
<p>let us</p>
<p>leave Telemachus to deal with him,</p>
<p>for it is to his house that he has</p>
<p>come.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and his saying pleased them well,</p>
<p>so Mulius of</p>
<p>Dulichium,</p>
<p>servant to Amphinomus,</p>
<p>mixed them a bowl of wine and water</p>
<p>and handed it round to each of them man by man,</p>
<p>whereon they made their</p>
<p>drink-offerings to the blessed gods: Then,</p>
<p>when they had made their</p>
<p>drink-offerings and had drunk each one as he was minded,</p>
<p>they took</p>
<p>their several ways each of them to his own abode.</p>

<p>TELEMACHUS AND ULYSSES REMOVE THE ARMOUR‚ÄîULYSSES INTERVIEWS</p>
<p>PENELOPE‚ÄîEURYCLEA WASHES HIS FEET AND RECOGNISES THE SCAR ON HIS</p>
<p>LEG‚ÄîPENELOPE TELLS HER DREAM TO ULYSSES.</p>
<p>Ulysses was left in the cloister,</p>
<p>pondering on the means whereby with</p>
<p>Minerva‚Äôs help he might be able to kill the suitors. Presently he said</p>
<p>to Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>we must get the armour together and take it</p>
<p>down inside. Make some excuse when the suitors ask you why you have</p>
<p>removed it. Say that you have taken it to be out of the way of the</p>
<p>smoke,</p>
<p>inasmuch as it is no longer what it was when Ulysses went away,</p>
<p>but has become soiled and begrimed with soot. Add to this more</p>
<p>particularly that you are afraid Jove may set them on to quarrel over</p>
<p>their wine,</p>
<p>and that they may do each other some harm which may</p>
<p>disgrace both banquet and wooing,</p>
<p>for the sight of arms sometimes</p>
<p>tempts people to use them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus approved of what his father had said,</p>
<p>so he called nurse</p>
<p>Euryclea and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>shut the women up in their room,</p>
<p>while I</p>
<p>take the armour that my father left behind him down into the store</p>
<p>room. No one looks after it now my father is gone,</p>
<p>and it has got all</p>
<p>smirched with soot during my own boyhood. I want to take it down where</p>
<p>the smoke cannot reach it.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI wish,</p>
<p>child,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat you would take the management</p>
<p>of the house into your own hands altogether,</p>
<p>and look after all the</p>
<p>property yourself. But who is to go with you and light you to the</p>
<p>store-room? The maids would have done so,</p>
<p>but you would not let them.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúshall show me a light; when people</p>
<p>eat my bread they must earn it,</p>
<p>no matter where they come from.‚Äù</p>
<p>Euryclea did as she was told,</p>
<p>and bolted the women inside their room.</p>
<p>Then Ulysses and his son made all haste to take the helmets,</p>
<p>shields,</p>
<p>and spears inside; and Minerva went before them with a gold lamp in her</p>
<p>hand that shed a soft and brilliant radiance,</p>
<p>whereon Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>my eyes behold a great marvel: the walls,</p>
<p>with the rafters,</p>
<p>crossbeams,</p>
<p>and the supports on which they rest are all aglow as with a</p>
<p>flaming fire. Surely there is some god here who has come down from</p>
<p>heaven.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHush,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúhold your peace and ask no questions,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>this is the manner of the gods. Get you to your bed,</p>
<p>and leave me here</p>
<p>to talk with your mother and the maids. Your mother in her grief will</p>
<p>ask me all sorts of questions.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Telemachus went by torch-light to the other side of the inner</p>
<p>court,</p>
<p>to the room in which he always slept. There he lay in his bed</p>
<p>till morning,</p>
<p>while Ulysses was left in the cloister pondering on the</p>
<p>means whereby with Minerva‚Äôs help he might be able to kill the suitors.</p>
<p>Then Penelope came down from her room looking like Venus or Diana,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>they set her a seat inlaid with scrolls of silver and ivory near the</p>
<p>fire in her accustomed place. It had been made by Icmalius and had a</p>
<p>footstool all in one piece with the seat itself; and it was covered</p>
<p>with a thick fleece: on this she now sat,</p>
<p>and the maids came from the</p>
<p>women‚Äôs room to join her. They set about removing the tables at which</p>
<p>the wicked suitors had been dining,</p>
<p>and took away the bread that was</p>
<p>left,</p>
<p>with the cups from which they had drunk. They emptied the embers</p>
<p>out of the braziers,</p>
<p>and heaped much wood upon them to give both light</p>
<p>and heat; but Melantho began to rail at Ulysses a second time and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>do you mean to plague us by hanging about the house all</p>
<p>night and spying upon the women? Be off,</p>
<p>you wretch,</p>
<p>outside,</p>
<p>and eat</p>
<p>your supper there,</p>
<p>or you shall be driven out with a firebrand.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses scowled at her and answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy good woman,</p>
<p>why should you be</p>
<p>so angry with me? Is it because I am not clean,</p>
<p>and my clothes are all</p>
<p>in rags,</p>
<p>and because I am obliged to go begging about after the manner</p>
<p>of tramps and beggars generally? I too was a rich man once,</p>
<p>and had a</p>
<p>fine house of my own; in those days I gave to many a tramp such as I</p>
<p>now am,</p>
<p>no matter who he might be nor what he wanted. I had any number</p>
<p>of servants,</p>
<p>and all the other things which people have who live well</p>
<p>and are accounted wealthy,</p>
<p>but it pleased Jove to take all away from</p>
<p>me; therefore,</p>
<p>woman,</p>
<p>beware lest you too come to lose that pride and</p>
<p>place in which you now wanton above your fellows; have a care lest you</p>
<p>get out of favour with your mistress,</p>
<p>and lest Ulysses should come</p>
<p>home,</p>
<p>for there is still a chance that he may do so. Moreover,</p>
<p>though</p>
<p>he be dead as you think he is,</p>
<p>yet by Apollo‚Äôs will he has left a son</p>
<p>behind him,</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>who will note anything done amiss by the maids</p>
<p>in the house,</p>
<p>for he is now no longer in his boyhood.‚Äù</p>
<p>Penelope heard what he was saying and scolded the maid,</p>
<p>‚ÄúImpudent</p>
<p>baggage,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see how abominably you are behaving,</p>
<p>and you</p>
<p>shall smart for it. You knew perfectly well,</p>
<p>for I told you myself,</p>
<p>that I was going to see the stranger and ask him about my husband,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>whose sake I am in such continual sorrow.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then she said to her head waiting woman Eurynome,</p>
<p>‚ÄúBring a seat with a</p>
<p>fleece upon it,</p>
<p>for the stranger to sit upon while he tells his story,</p>
<p>and listens to what I have to say. I wish to ask him some questions.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eurynome brought the seat at once and set a fleece upon it,</p>
<p>and as soon</p>
<p>as Ulysses had sat down Penelope began by saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>I shall</p>
<p>first ask you who and whence are you? Tell me of your town and</p>
<p>parents.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúwho on the face of the whole earth can dare</p>
<p>to chide with you? Your fame reaches the firmament of heaven itself;</p>
<p>you are like some blameless king,</p>
<p>who upholds righteousness,</p>
<p>as the</p>
<p>monarch over a great and valiant nation: the earth yields its wheat and</p>
<p>barley,</p>
<p>the trees are loaded with fruit,</p>
<p>the ewes bring forth lambs,</p>
<p>and the sea abounds with fish by reason of his virtues,</p>
<p>and his people</p>
<p>do good deeds under him. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>as I sit here in your house,</p>
<p>ask</p>
<p>me some other question and do not seek to know my race and family,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>you will recall memories that will yet more increase my sorrow. I am</p>
<p>full of heaviness,</p>
<p>but I ought not to sit weeping and wailing in</p>
<p>another person‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>nor is it well to be thus grieving continually.</p>
<p>I shall have one of the servants or even yourself complaining of me,</p>
<p>and saying that my eyes swim with tears because I am heavy with wine.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Penelope answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>heaven robbed me of all beauty,</p>
<p>whether of face or figure,</p>
<p>when the Argives set sail for Troy and my</p>
<p>dear husband with them. If he were to return and look after my affairs</p>
<p>I should be both more respected and should show a better presence to</p>
<p>the world. As it is,</p>
<p>I am oppressed with care,</p>
<p>and with the afflictions</p>
<p>which heaven has seen fit to heap upon me. The chiefs from all our</p>
<p>islands‚ÄîDulichium,</p>
<p>Same,</p>
<p>and Zacynthus,</p>
<p>as also from Ithaca itself,</p>
<p>are</p>
<p>wooing me against my will and are wasting my estate. I can therefore</p>
<p>show no attention to strangers,</p>
<p>nor suppliants,</p>
<p>nor to people who say</p>
<p>that they are skilled artisans,</p>
<p>but am all the time broken-hearted</p>
<p>about Ulysses. They want me to marry again at once,</p>
<p>and I have to</p>
<p>invent stratagems in order to deceive them. In the first place heaven</p>
<p>put it in my mind to set up a great tambour-frame in my room,</p>
<p>and to</p>
<p>begin working upon an enormous piece of fine needlework. Then I said to</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>‚ÄòSweethearts,</p>
<p>Ulysses is indeed dead,</p>
<p>still,</p>
<p>do not press me to</p>
<p>marry again immediately; wait‚Äîfor I would not have my skill in</p>
<p>needlework perish unrecorded‚Äîtill I have finished making a pall for the</p>
<p>hero Laertes,</p>
<p>to be ready against the time when death shall take him.</p>
<p>He is very rich,</p>
<p>and the women of the place will talk if he is laid out</p>
<p>without a pall.‚Äô This was what I said,</p>
<p>and they assented; whereon I</p>
<p>used to keep working at my great web all day long,</p>
<p>but at night I would</p>
<p>unpick the stitches again by torch light. I fooled them in this way for</p>
<p>three years without their finding it out,</p>
<p>but as time wore on and I was</p>
<p>now in my fourth year,</p>
<p>in the waning of moons,</p>
<p>and many days had been</p>
<p>accomplished,</p>
<p>those good for nothing hussies my maids betrayed me to</p>
<p>the suitors,</p>
<p>who broke in upon me and caught me; they were very angry</p>
<p>with me,</p>
<p>so I was forced to finish my work whether I would or no. And</p>
<p>now I do not see how I can find any further shift for getting out of</p>
<p>this marriage. My parents are putting great pressure upon me,</p>
<p>and my</p>
<p>son chafes at the ravages the suitors are making upon his estate,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he is now old enough to understand all about it and is perfectly able</p>
<p>to look after his own affairs,</p>
<p>for heaven has blessed him with an</p>
<p>excellent disposition. Still,</p>
<p>notwithstanding all this,</p>
<p>tell me who you</p>
<p>are and where you come from‚Äîfor you must have had father and mother of</p>
<p>some sort; you cannot be the son of an oak or of a rock.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>wife of Ulysses,</p>
<p>since you persist in</p>
<p>asking me about my family,</p>
<p>I will answer,</p>
<p>no matter what it costs me:</p>
<p>people must expect to be pained when they have been exiles as long as I</p>
<p>have,</p>
<p>and suffered as much among as many peoples. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>as</p>
<p>regards your question I will tell you all you ask. There is a fair and</p>
<p>fruitful island in mid-ocean called Crete; it is thickly peopled and</p>
<p>there are ninety cities in it: the people speak many different</p>
<p>languages which overlap one another,</p>
<p>for there are Achaeans,</p>
<p>brave</p>
<p>Eteocretans,</p>
<p>Dorians of three-fold race,</p>
<p>and noble Pelasgi. There is a</p>
<p>great town there,</p>
<p>Cnossus,</p>
<p>where Minos reigned who every nine years had</p>
<p>a conference with Jove himself.152 Minos was father to Deucalion,</p>
<p>whose</p>
<p>son I am,</p>
<p>for Deucalion had two sons Idomeneus and myself. Idomeneus</p>
<p>sailed for Troy,</p>
<p>and I,</p>
<p>who am the younger,</p>
<p>am called Aethon; my</p>
<p>brother,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>was at once the older and the more valiant of the</p>
<p>two; hence it was in Crete that I saw Ulysses and showed him</p>
<p>hospitality,</p>
<p>for the winds took him there as he was on his way to Troy,</p>
<p>carrying him out of his course from cape Malea and leaving him in</p>
<p>Amnisus off the cave of Ilithuia,</p>
<p>where the harbours are difficult to</p>
<p>enter and he could hardly find shelter from the winds that were then</p>
<p>raging. As soon as he got there he went into the town and asked for</p>
<p>Idomeneus,</p>
<p>claiming to be his old and valued friend,</p>
<p>but Idomeneus had</p>
<p>already set sail for Troy some ten or twelve days earlier,</p>
<p>so I took</p>
<p>him to my own house and showed him every kind of hospitality,</p>
<p>for I had</p>
<p>abundance of everything. Moreover,</p>
<p>I fed the men who were with him with</p>
<p>barley meal from the public store,</p>
<p>and got subscriptions of wine and</p>
<p>oxen for them to sacrifice to their heart‚Äôs content. They stayed with</p>
<p>me twelve days,</p>
<p>for there was a gale blowing from the North so strong</p>
<p>that one could hardly keep one‚Äôs feet on land. I suppose some</p>
<p>unfriendly god had raised it for them,</p>
<p>but on the thirteenth day the</p>
<p>wind dropped,</p>
<p>and they got away.‚Äù</p>
<p>Many a plausible tale did Ulysses further tell her,</p>
<p>and Penelope wept</p>
<p>as she listened,</p>
<p>for her heart was melted. As the snow wastes upon the</p>
<p>mountain tops when the winds from South East and West have breathed</p>
<p>upon it and thawed it till the rivers run bank full with water,</p>
<p>even so</p>
<p>did her cheeks overflow with tears for the husband who was all the time</p>
<p>sitting by her side. Ulysses felt for her and was sorry for her,</p>
<p>but he</p>
<p>kept his eyes as hard as horn or iron without letting them so much as</p>
<p>quiver,</p>
<p>so cunningly did he restrain his tears. Then,</p>
<p>when she had</p>
<p>relieved herself by weeping,</p>
<p>she turned to him again and said: ‚ÄúNow,</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>I shall put you to the test and see whether or no you really</p>
<p>did entertain my husband and his men,</p>
<p>as you say you did. Tell me,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>how he was dressed,</p>
<p>what kind of a man he was to look at,</p>
<p>and so</p>
<p>also with his companions.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúit is such a long time ago that I can</p>
<p>hardly say. Twenty years are come and gone since he left my home,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>went elsewhither; but I will tell you as well as I can recollect.</p>
<p>Ulysses wore a mantle of purple wool,</p>
<p>double lined,</p>
<p>and it was fastened</p>
<p>by a gold brooch with two catches for the pin. On the face of this</p>
<p>there was a device that shewed a dog holding a spotted fawn between his</p>
<p>fore paws,</p>
<p>and watching it as it lay panting upon the ground. Every one</p>
<p>marvelled at the way in which these things had been done in gold,</p>
<p>the</p>
<p>dog looking at the fawn,</p>
<p>and strangling it,</p>
<p>while the fawn was</p>
<p>struggling convulsively to escape.153 As for the shirt that he wore</p>
<p>next his skin,</p>
<p>it was so soft that it fitted him like the skin of an</p>
<p>onion,</p>
<p>and glistened in the sunlight to the admiration of all the women</p>
<p>who beheld it. Furthermore I say,</p>
<p>and lay my saying to your heart,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>I do not know whether Ulysses wore these clothes when he left home,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>whether one of his companions had given them to him while he was on his</p>
<p>voyage; or possibly some one at whose house he was staying made him a</p>
<p>present of them,</p>
<p>for he was a man of many friends and had few equals</p>
<p>among the Achaeans. I myself gave him a sword of bronze and a beautiful</p>
<p>purple mantle,</p>
<p>double lined,</p>
<p>with a shirt that went down to his feet,</p>
<p>and I sent him on board his ship with every mark of honour. He had a</p>
<p>servant with him,</p>
<p>a little older than himself,</p>
<p>and I can tell you what</p>
<p>he was like; his shoulders were hunched,</p>
<p>154 he was dark,</p>
<p>and he had</p>
<p>thick curly hair. His name was Eurybates,</p>
<p>and Ulysses treated him with</p>
<p>greater familiarity than he did any of the others,</p>
<p>as being the most</p>
<p>like-minded with himself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Penelope was moved still more deeply as she heard the indisputable</p>
<p>proofs that Ulysses laid before her; and when she had again found</p>
<p>relief in tears she said to him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>I was already disposed to</p>
<p>pity you,</p>
<p>but henceforth you shall be honoured and made welcome in my</p>
<p>house. It was I who gave Ulysses the clothes you speak of. I took them</p>
<p>out of the store room and folded them up myself,</p>
<p>and I gave him also</p>
<p>the gold brooch to wear as an ornament. Alas! I shall never welcome him</p>
<p>home again. It was by an ill fate that he ever set out for that</p>
<p>detested city whose very name I cannot bring myself even to mention.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>wife of Ulysses,</p>
<p>do not disfigure</p>
<p>yourself further by grieving thus bitterly for your loss,</p>
<p>though I can</p>
<p>hardly blame you for doing so. A woman who has loved her husband and</p>
<p>borne him children,</p>
<p>would naturally be grieved at losing him,</p>
<p>even</p>
<p>though he were a worse man than Ulysses,</p>
<p>who they say was like a god.</p>
<p>Still,</p>
<p>cease your tears and listen to what I can tell you. I will hide</p>
<p>nothing from you,</p>
<p>and can say with perfect truth that I have lately</p>
<p>heard of Ulysses as being alive and on his way home; he is among the</p>
<p>Thesprotians,</p>
<p>and is bringing back much valuable treasure that he has</p>
<p>begged from one and another of them; but his ship and all his crew were</p>
<p>lost as they were leaving the Thrinacian island,</p>
<p>for Jove and the</p>
<p>sun-god were angry with him because his men had slaughtered the</p>
<p>sun-god‚Äôs cattle,</p>
<p>and they were all drowned to a man. But Ulysses stuck</p>
<p>to the keel of the ship and was drifted on to the land of the</p>
<p>Phaeacians,</p>
<p>who are near of kin to the immortals,</p>
<p>and who treated him</p>
<p>as though he had been a god,</p>
<p>giving him many presents,</p>
<p>and wishing to</p>
<p>escort him home safe and sound. In fact Ulysses would have been here</p>
<p>long ago,</p>
<p>had he not thought better to go from land to land gathering</p>
<p>wealth; for there is no man living who is so wily as he is; there is no</p>
<p>one can compare with him. Pheidon king of the Thesprotians told me all</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>and he swore to me‚Äîmaking drink-offerings in his house as he did</p>
<p>so‚Äîthat the ship was by the water side and the crew found who would</p>
<p>take Ulysses to his own country. He sent me off first,</p>
<p>for there</p>
<p>happened to be a Thesprotian ship sailing for the wheat-growing island</p>
<p>of Dulichium,</p>
<p>but he showed me all the treasure Ulysses had got</p>
<p>together,</p>
<p>and he had enough lying in the house of king Pheidon to keep</p>
<p>his family for ten generations; but the king said Ulysses had gone to</p>
<p>Dodona that he might learn Jove‚Äôs mind from the high oak tree,</p>
<p>and know</p>
<p>whether after so long an absence he should return to Ithaca openly or</p>
<p>in secret. So you may know he is safe and will be here shortly; he is</p>
<p>close at hand and cannot remain away from home much longer;</p>
<p>nevertheless I will confirm my words with an oath,</p>
<p>and call Jove who is</p>
<p>the first and mightiest of all gods to witness,</p>
<p>as also that hearth of</p>
<p>Ulysses to which I have now come,</p>
<p>that all I have spoken shall surely</p>
<p>come to pass. Ulysses will return in this self same year; with the end</p>
<p>of this moon and the beginning of the next he will be here.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay it be even so,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Penelope; ‚Äúif your words come true you</p>
<p>shall have such gifts and such good will from me that all who see you</p>
<p>shall congratulate you; but I know very well how it will be. Ulysses</p>
<p>will not return,</p>
<p>neither will you get your escort hence,</p>
<p>for so surely</p>
<p>as that Ulysses ever was,</p>
<p>there are now no longer any such masters in</p>
<p>the house as he was,</p>
<p>to receive honourable strangers or to further them</p>
<p>on their way home. And now,</p>
<p>you maids,</p>
<p>wash his feet for him,</p>
<p>and make</p>
<p>him a bed on a couch with rugs and blankets,</p>
<p>that he may be warm and</p>
<p>quiet till morning. Then,</p>
<p>at day break wash him and anoint him again,</p>
<p>that he may sit in the cloister and take his meals with Telemachus. It</p>
<p>shall be the worse for any one of these hateful people who is uncivil</p>
<p>to him; like it or not,</p>
<p>he shall have no more to do in this house. For</p>
<p>how,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>shall you be able to learn whether or no I am superior to</p>
<p>others of my sex both in goodness of heart and understanding,</p>
<p>if I let</p>
<p>you dine in my cloisters squalid and ill clad? Men live but for a</p>
<p>little season; if they are hard,</p>
<p>and deal hardly,</p>
<p>people wish them ill</p>
<p>so long as they are alive,</p>
<p>and speak contemptuously of them when they</p>
<p>are dead,</p>
<p>but he that is righteous and deals righteously,</p>
<p>the people</p>
<p>tell of his praise among all lands,</p>
<p>and many shall call him blessed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>I have foresworn rugs and blankets from the</p>
<p>day that I left the snowy ranges of Crete to go on shipboard. I will</p>
<p>lie as I have lain on many a sleepless night hitherto. Night after</p>
<p>night have I passed in any rough sleeping place,</p>
<p>and waited for</p>
<p>morning. Nor,</p>
<p>again,</p>
<p>do I like having my feet washed; I shall not let</p>
<p>any of the young hussies about your house touch my feet; but,</p>
<p>if you</p>
<p>have any old and respectable woman who has gone through as much trouble</p>
<p>as I have,</p>
<p>I will allow her to wash them.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Penelope said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear sir,</p>
<p>of all the guests who ever yet</p>
<p>came to my house there never was one who spoke in all things with such</p>
<p>admirable propriety as you do. There happens to be in the house a most</p>
<p>respectable old woman‚Äîthe same who received my poor dear husband in her</p>
<p>arms the night he was born,</p>
<p>and nursed him in infancy. She is very</p>
<p>feeble now,</p>
<p>but she shall wash your feet.‚Äù ‚ÄúCome here,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEuryclea,</p>
<p>and wash your master‚Äôs age-mate; I suppose Ulysses‚Äô hands</p>
<p>and feet are very much the same now as his are,</p>
<p>for trouble ages all of</p>
<p>us dreadfully fast.‚Äù</p>
<p>On these words the old woman covered her face with her hands; she began</p>
<p>to weep and made lamentation saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear child,</p>
<p>I cannot think</p>
<p>whatever I am to do with you. I am certain no one was ever more</p>
<p>god-fearing than yourself,</p>
<p>and yet Jove hates you. No one in the whole</p>
<p>world ever burned him more thigh bones,</p>
<p>nor gave him finer hecatombs</p>
<p>when you prayed you might come to a green old age yourself and see your</p>
<p>son grow up to take after you: yet see how he has prevented you alone</p>
<p>from ever getting back to your own home. I have no doubt the women in</p>
<p>some foreign palace which Ulysses has got to are gibing at him as all</p>
<p>these sluts here have been gibing at you. I do not wonder at your not</p>
<p>choosing to let them wash you after the manner in which they have</p>
<p>insulted you; I will wash your feet myself gladly enough,</p>
<p>as Penelope</p>
<p>has said that I am to do so; I will wash them both for Penelope‚Äôs sake</p>
<p>and for your own,</p>
<p>for you have raised the most lively feelings of</p>
<p>compassion in my mind; and let me say this moreover,</p>
<p>which pray attend</p>
<p>to; we have had all kinds of strangers in distress come here before</p>
<p>now,</p>
<p>but I make bold to say that no one ever yet came who was so like</p>
<p>Ulysses in figure,</p>
<p>voice,</p>
<p>and feet as you are.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThose who have seen us both,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúhave always said we</p>
<p>were wonderfully like each other,</p>
<p>and now you have noticed it too.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then the old woman took the cauldron in which she was going to wash his</p>
<p>feet,</p>
<p>and poured plenty of cold water into it,</p>
<p>adding hot till the bath</p>
<p>was warm enough. Ulysses sat by the fire,</p>
<p>but ere long he turned away</p>
<p>from the light,</p>
<p>for it occurred to him that when the old woman had hold</p>
<p>of his leg she would recognise a certain scar which it bore,</p>
<p>whereon</p>
<p>the whole truth would come out. And indeed as soon as she began washing</p>
<p>her master,</p>
<p>she at once knew the scar as one that had been given him by</p>
<p>a wild boar when he was hunting on Mt. Parnassus with his excellent</p>
<p>grandfather Autolycus‚Äîwho was the most accomplished thief and perjurer</p>
<p>in the whole world‚Äîand with the sons of Autolycus. Mercury himself had</p>
<p>endowed him with this gift,</p>
<p>for he used to burn the thigh bones of</p>
<p>goats and kids to him,</p>
<p>so he took pleasure in his companionship. It</p>
<p>happened once that Autolycus had gone to Ithaca and had found the child</p>
<p>of his daughter just born. As soon as he had done supper Euryclea set</p>
<p>the infant upon his knees and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAutolycus,</p>
<p>you must find a name</p>
<p>for your grandson; you greatly wished that you might have one.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúSon-in-law and daughter,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Autolycus,</p>
<p>‚Äúcall the child thus: I</p>
<p>am highly displeased with a large number of people in one place and</p>
<p>another,</p>
<p>both men and women; so name the child ‚ÄòUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äô or the child</p>
<p>of anger. When he grows up and comes to visit his mother‚Äôs family on</p>
<p>Mt. Parnassus,</p>
<p>where my possessions lie,</p>
<p>I will make him a present and</p>
<p>will send him on his way rejoicing.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>went to Parnassus to get the presents from</p>
<p>Autolycus,</p>
<p>who with his sons shook hands with him and gave him welcome.</p>
<p>His grandmother Amphithea threw her arms about him,</p>
<p>and kissed his</p>
<p>head,</p>
<p>and both his beautiful eyes,</p>
<p>while Autolycus desired his sons to</p>
<p>get dinner ready,</p>
<p>and they did as he told them. They brought in a five</p>
<p>year old bull,</p>
<p>flayed it,</p>
<p>made it ready and divided it into joints;</p>
<p>these they then cut carefully up into smaller pieces and spitted them;</p>
<p>they roasted them sufficiently and served the portions round. Thus</p>
<p>through the livelong day to the going down of the sun they feasted,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>every man had his full share so that all were satisfied; but when the</p>
<p>sun set and it came on dark,</p>
<p>they went to bed and enjoyed the boon of</p>
<p>sleep.</p>
<p>When the child of morning,</p>
<p>rosy-fingered Dawn,</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>the sons of</p>
<p>Autolycus went out with their hounds hunting,</p>
<p>and Ulysses went too.</p>
<p>They climbed the wooded slopes of Parnassus and soon reached its breezy</p>
<p>upland valleys; but as the sun was beginning to beat upon the fields,</p>
<p>fresh-risen from the slow still currents of Oceanus,</p>
<p>they came to a</p>
<p>mountain dell. The dogs were in front searching for the tracks of the</p>
<p>beast they were chasing,</p>
<p>and after them came the sons of Autolycus,</p>
<p>among whom was Ulysses,</p>
<p>close behind the dogs,</p>
<p>and he had a long spear</p>
<p>in his hand. Here was the lair of a huge boar among some thick</p>
<p>brushwood,</p>
<p>so dense that the wind and rain could not get through it,</p>
<p>nor could the sun‚Äôs rays pierce it,</p>
<p>and the ground underneath lay thick</p>
<p>with fallen leaves. The boar heard the noise of the men‚Äôs feet,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>hounds baying on every side as the huntsmen came up to him,</p>
<p>so he</p>
<p>rushed from his lair,</p>
<p>raised the bristles on his neck,</p>
<p>and stood at bay</p>
<p>with fire flashing from his eyes. Ulysses was the first to raise his</p>
<p>spear and try to drive it into the brute,</p>
<p>but the boar was too quick</p>
<p>for him,</p>
<p>and charged him sideways,</p>
<p>ripping him above the knee with a</p>
<p>gash that tore deep though it did not reach the bone. As for the boar,</p>
<p>Ulysses hit him on the right shoulder,</p>
<p>and the point of the spear went</p>
<p>right through him,</p>
<p>so that he fell groaning in the dust until the life</p>
<p>went out of him. The sons of Autolycus busied themselves with the</p>
<p>carcass of the boar,</p>
<p>and bound Ulysses‚Äô wound; then,</p>
<p>after saying a</p>
<p>spell to stop the bleeding,</p>
<p>they went home as fast as they could. But</p>
<p>when Autolycus and his sons had thoroughly healed Ulysses,</p>
<p>they made</p>
<p>him some splendid presents,</p>
<p>and sent him back to Ithaca with much</p>
<p>mutual good will. When he got back,</p>
<p>his father and mother were rejoiced</p>
<p>to see him,</p>
<p>and asked him all about it,</p>
<p>and how he had hurt himself to</p>
<p>get the scar; so he told them how the boar had ripped him when he was</p>
<p>out hunting with Autolycus and his sons on Mt. Parnassus.</p>
<p>As soon as Euryclea had got the scarred limb in her hands and had well</p>
<p>hold of it,</p>
<p>she recognised it and dropped the foot at once. The leg</p>
<p>fell into the bath,</p>
<p>which rang out and was overturned,</p>
<p>so that all the</p>
<p>water was spilt on the ground; Euryclea‚Äôs eyes between her joy and her</p>
<p>grief filled with tears,</p>
<p>and she could not speak,</p>
<p>but she caught</p>
<p>Ulysses by the beard and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear child,</p>
<p>I am sure you must be</p>
<p>Ulysses himself,</p>
<p>only I did not know you till I had actually touched</p>
<p>and handled you.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke she looked towards Penelope,</p>
<p>as though wanting to tell her</p>
<p>that her dear husband was in the house,</p>
<p>but Penelope was unable to look</p>
<p>in that direction and observe what was going on,</p>
<p>for Minerva had</p>
<p>diverted her attention; so Ulysses caught Euryclea by the throat with</p>
<p>his right hand and with his left drew her close to him,</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>do you wish to be the ruin of me,</p>
<p>you who nursed me at your own</p>
<p>breast,</p>
<p>now that after twenty years of wandering I am at last come to</p>
<p>my own home again? Since it has been borne in upon you by heaven to</p>
<p>recognise me,</p>
<p>hold your tongue,</p>
<p>and do not say a word about it to any</p>
<p>one else in the house,</p>
<p>for if you do I tell you‚Äîand it shall surely</p>
<p>be‚Äîthat if heaven grants me to take the lives of these suitors,</p>
<p>I will</p>
<p>not spare you,</p>
<p>though you are my own nurse,</p>
<p>when I am killing the other</p>
<p>women.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy child,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat are you talking about? You know</p>
<p>very well that nothing can either bend or break me. I will hold my</p>
<p>tongue like a stone or a piece of iron; furthermore let me say,</p>
<p>and lay</p>
<p>my saying to your heart,</p>
<p>when heaven has delivered the suitors into</p>
<p>your hand,</p>
<p>I will give you a list of the women in the house who have</p>
<p>been ill-behaved,</p>
<p>and of those who are guiltless.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>you ought not to speak in that way; I am</p>
<p>well able to form my own opinion about one and all of them; hold your</p>
<p>tongue and leave everything to heaven.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he said this Euryclea left the cloister to fetch some more water,</p>
<p>for the first had been all spilt; and when she had washed him and</p>
<p>anointed him with oil,</p>
<p>Ulysses drew his seat nearer to the fire to warm</p>
<p>himself,</p>
<p>and hid the scar under his rags. Then Penelope began talking</p>
<p>to him and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>I should like to speak with you briefly about another</p>
<p>matter. It is indeed nearly bed time‚Äîfor those,</p>
<p>at least,</p>
<p>who can sleep</p>
<p>in spite of sorrow. As for myself,</p>
<p>heaven has given me a life of such</p>
<p>unmeasurable woe,</p>
<p>that even by day when I am attending to my duties and</p>
<p>looking after the servants,</p>
<p>I am still weeping and lamenting during the</p>
<p>whole time; then,</p>
<p>when night comes,</p>
<p>and we all of us go to bed,</p>
<p>I lie</p>
<p>awake thinking,</p>
<p>and my heart becomes a prey to the most incessant and</p>
<p>cruel tortures. As the dun nightingale,</p>
<p>daughter of Pandareus,</p>
<p>sings in</p>
<p>the early spring from her seat in shadiest covert hid,</p>
<p>and with many a</p>
<p>plaintive trill pours out the tale how by mishap she killed her own</p>
<p>child Itylus,</p>
<p>son of king Zethus,</p>
<p>even so does my mind toss and turn in</p>
<p>its uncertainty whether I ought to stay with my son here,</p>
<p>and safeguard</p>
<p>my substance,</p>
<p>my bondsmen,</p>
<p>and the greatness of my house,</p>
<p>out of regard</p>
<p>to public opinion and the memory of my late husband,</p>
<p>or whether it is</p>
<p>not now time for me to go with the best of these suitors who are wooing</p>
<p>me and making me such magnificent presents. As long as my son was still</p>
<p>young,</p>
<p>and unable to understand,</p>
<p>he would not hear of my leaving my</p>
<p>husband‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>but now that he is full grown he begs and prays me to</p>
<p>do so,</p>
<p>being incensed at the way in which the suitors are eating up his</p>
<p>property. Listen,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>to a dream that I have had and interpret it for</p>
<p>me if you can. I have twenty geese about the house that eat mash out of</p>
<p>a trough,</p>
<p>155 and of which I am exceedingly fond. I dreamed that a great</p>
<p>eagle came swooping down from a mountain,</p>
<p>and dug his curved beak into</p>
<p>the neck of each of them till he had killed them all. Presently he</p>
<p>soared off into the sky,</p>
<p>and left them lying dead about the yard;</p>
<p>whereon I wept in my dream till all my maids gathered round me,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>piteously was I grieving because the eagle had killed my geese. Then he</p>
<p>came back again,</p>
<p>and perching on a projecting rafter spoke to me with</p>
<p>human voice,</p>
<p>and told me to leave off crying. ‚ÄòBe of good courage,</p>
<p>‚Äô he</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚Äòdaughter of Icarius; this is no dream,</p>
<p>but a vision of good omen</p>
<p>that shall surely come to pass. The geese are the suitors,</p>
<p>and I am no</p>
<p>longer an eagle,</p>
<p>but your own husband,</p>
<p>who am come back to you,</p>
<p>and who</p>
<p>will bring these suitors to a disgraceful end.‚Äô On this I woke,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>when I looked out I saw my geese at the trough eating their mash as</p>
<p>usual.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis dream,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúcan admit but of one</p>
<p>interpretation,</p>
<p>for had not Ulysses himself told you how it shall be</p>
<p>fulfilled? The death of the suitors is portended,</p>
<p>and not one single</p>
<p>one of them will escape.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Penelope answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>dreams are very curious and</p>
<p>unaccountable things,</p>
<p>and they do not by any means invariably come</p>
<p>true. There are two gates through which these unsubstantial fancies</p>
<p>proceed; the one is of horn,</p>
<p>and the other ivory. Those that come</p>
<p>through the gate of ivory are fatuous,</p>
<p>but those from the gate of horn</p>
<p>mean something to those that see them. I do not think,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that my</p>
<p>own dream came through the gate of horn,</p>
<p>though I and my son should be</p>
<p>most thankful if it proves to have done so. Furthermore I say‚Äîand lay</p>
<p>my saying to your heart‚Äîthe coming dawn will usher in the ill-omened</p>
<p>day that is to sever me from the house of Ulysses,</p>
<p>for I am about to</p>
<p>hold a tournament of axes. My husband used to set up twelve axes in the</p>
<p>court,</p>
<p>one in front of the other,</p>
<p>like the stays upon which a ship is</p>
<p>built; he would then go back from them and shoot an arrow through the</p>
<p>whole twelve. I shall make the suitors try to do the same thing,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>whichever of them can string the bow most easily,</p>
<p>and send his arrow</p>
<p>through all the twelve axes,</p>
<p>him will I follow,</p>
<p>and quit this house of</p>
<p>my lawful husband,</p>
<p>so goodly and so abounding in wealth. But even so,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMadam,</p>
<p>wife of Ulysses,</p>
<p>you need not defer your</p>
<p>tournament,</p>
<p>for Ulysses will return ere ever they can string the bow,</p>
<p>handle it how they will,</p>
<p>and send their arrows through the iron.‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Penelope said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAs long,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>as you will sit here and talk to</p>
<p>me,</p>
<p>I can have no desire to go to bed. Still,</p>
<p>people cannot do</p>
<p>permanently without sleep,</p>
<p>and heaven has appointed us dwellers on</p>
<p>earth a time for all things. I will therefore go upstairs and recline</p>
<p>upon that couch which I have never ceased to flood with my tears from</p>
<p>the day Ulysses set out for the city with a hateful name.‚Äù</p>
<p>She then went upstairs to her own room,</p>
<p>not alone,</p>
<p>but attended by her</p>
<p>maidens,</p>
<p>and when there,</p>
<p>she lamented her dear husband till Minerva</p>
<p>shed sweet sleep over her eyelids.</p>

<p>ULYSSES CANNOT SLEEP‚ÄîPENELOPE‚ÄôS PRAYER TO DIANA‚ÄîTHE TWO SIGNS FROM</p>
<p>HEAVEN‚ÄîEUMAEUS AND PHILOETIUS ARRIVE‚ÄîTHE SUITORS DINE‚ÄîCTESIPPUS THROWS</p>
<p>AN OX‚ÄôS FOOT AT ULYSSES‚ÄîTHEOCLYMENUS FORETELLS DISASTER AND LEAVES THE</p>
<p>HOUSE.</p>
<p>Ulysses slept in the cloister upon an undressed bullock‚Äôs hide,</p>
<p>on the</p>
<p>top of which he threw several skins of the sheep the suitors had eaten,</p>
<p>and Eurynome156 threw a cloak over him after he had laid himself down.</p>
<p>There,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>Ulysses lay wakefully brooding upon the way in which he</p>
<p>should kill the suitors; and by and by,</p>
<p>the women who had been in the</p>
<p>habit of misconducting themselves with them,</p>
<p>left the house giggling</p>
<p>and laughing with one another. This made Ulysses very angry,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>doubted whether to get up and kill every single one of them then and</p>
<p>there,</p>
<p>or to let them sleep one more and last time with the suitors.</p>
<p>His heart growled within him,</p>
<p>and as a bitch with puppies growls and</p>
<p>shows her teeth when she sees a stranger,</p>
<p>so did his heart growl with</p>
<p>anger at the evil deeds that were being done: but he beat his breast</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHeart,</p>
<p>be still,</p>
<p>you had worse than this to bear on the day</p>
<p>when the terrible Cyclops ate your brave companions; yet you bore it in</p>
<p>silence till your cunning got you safe out of the cave,</p>
<p>though you made</p>
<p>sure of being killed.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus he chided with his heart,</p>
<p>and checked it into endurance,</p>
<p>but he</p>
<p>tossed about as one who turns a paunch full of blood and fat in front</p>
<p>of a hot fire,</p>
<p>doing it first on one side and then on the other,</p>
<p>that</p>
<p>he may get it cooked as soon as possible,</p>
<p>even so did he turn himself</p>
<p>about from side to side,</p>
<p>thinking all the time how,</p>
<p>single handed as he</p>
<p>was,</p>
<p>he should contrive to kill so large a body of men as the wicked</p>
<p>suitors. But by and by Minerva came down from heaven in the likeness of</p>
<p>a woman,</p>
<p>and hovered over his head saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy poor unhappy man,</p>
<p>why do</p>
<p>you lie awake in this way? This is your house: your wife is safe inside</p>
<p>it,</p>
<p>and so is your son who is just such a young man as any father may</p>
<p>be proud of.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúGoddess,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúall that you have said is true,</p>
<p>but I am</p>
<p>in some doubt as to how I shall be able to kill these wicked suitors</p>
<p>single handed,</p>
<p>seeing what a number of them there always are. And there</p>
<p>is this further difficulty,</p>
<p>which is still more considerable. Supposing</p>
<p>that with Jove‚Äôs and your assistance I succeed in killing them,</p>
<p>I must</p>
<p>ask you to consider where I am to escape to from their avengers when it</p>
<p>is all over.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFor shame,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Minerva,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhy,</p>
<p>any one else would trust a worse</p>
<p>ally than myself,</p>
<p>even though that ally were only a mortal and less</p>
<p>wise than I am. Am I not a goddess,</p>
<p>and have I not protected you</p>
<p>throughout in all your troubles? I tell you plainly that even though</p>
<p>there were fifty bands of men surrounding us and eager to kill us,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>should take all their sheep and cattle,</p>
<p>and drive them away with you.</p>
<p>But go to sleep; it is a very bad thing to lie awake all night,</p>
<p>and you</p>
<p>shall be out of your troubles before long.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke she shed sleep over his eyes,</p>
<p>and then went back to</p>
<p>Olympus.</p>
<p>While Ulysses was thus yielding himself to a very deep slumber that</p>
<p>eased the burden of his sorrows,</p>
<p>his admirable wife awoke,</p>
<p>and sitting</p>
<p>up in her bed began to cry. When she had relieved herself by weeping</p>
<p>she prayed to Diana saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúGreat Goddess Diana,</p>
<p>daughter of Jove,</p>
<p>drive an arrow into my heart and slay me; or let some whirlwind snatch</p>
<p>me up and bear me through paths of darkness till it drop me into the</p>
<p>mouths of over-flowing Oceanus,</p>
<p>as it did the daughters of Pandareus.</p>
<p>The daughters of Pandareus lost their father and mother,</p>
<p>for the gods</p>
<p>killed them,</p>
<p>so they were left orphans. But Venus took care of them,</p>
<p>and fed them on cheese,</p>
<p>honey,</p>
<p>and sweet wine. Juno taught them to</p>
<p>excel all women in beauty of form and understanding; Diana gave them an</p>
<p>imposing presence,</p>
<p>and Minerva endowed them with every kind of</p>
<p>accomplishment; but one day when Venus had gone up to Olympus to see</p>
<p>Jove about getting them married (for well does he know both what shall</p>
<p>happen and what not happen to every one) the storm winds came and</p>
<p>spirited them away to become handmaids to the dread Erinyes. Even so I</p>
<p>wish that the gods who live in heaven would hide me from mortal sight,</p>
<p>or that fair Diana might strike me,</p>
<p>for I would fain go even beneath</p>
<p>the sad earth if I might do so still looking towards Ulysses only,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>without having to yield myself to a worse man than he was. Besides,</p>
<p>no</p>
<p>matter how much people may grieve by day,</p>
<p>they can put up with it so</p>
<p>long as they can sleep at night,</p>
<p>for when the eyes are closed in</p>
<p>slumber people forget good and ill alike; whereas my misery haunts me</p>
<p>even in my dreams. This very night methought there was one lying by my</p>
<p>side who was like Ulysses as he was when he went away with his host,</p>
<p>and I rejoiced,</p>
<p>for I believed that it was no dream,</p>
<p>but the very truth</p>
<p>itself.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the day broke,</p>
<p>but Ulysses heard the sound of her weeping,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>it puzzled him,</p>
<p>for it seemed as though she already knew him and was by</p>
<p>his side. Then he gathered up the cloak and the fleeces on which he had</p>
<p>lain,</p>
<p>and set them on a seat in the cloister,</p>
<p>but he took the bullock‚Äôs</p>
<p>hide out into the open. He lifted up his hands to heaven,</p>
<p>and prayed,</p>
<p>saying ‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>since you have seen fit to bring me over land and</p>
<p>sea to my own home after all the afflictions you have laid upon me,</p>
<p>give me a sign out of the mouth of some one or other of those who are</p>
<p>now waking within the house,</p>
<p>and let me have another sign of some kind</p>
<p>from outside.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he pray. Jove heard his prayer and forthwith thundered high up</p>
<p>among the clouds from the splendour of Olympus,</p>
<p>and Ulysses was glad</p>
<p>when he heard it. At the same time within the house,</p>
<p>a miller-woman</p>
<p>from hard by in the mill room lifted up her voice and gave him another</p>
<p>sign. There were twelve miller-women whose business it was to grind</p>
<p>wheat and barley which are the staff of life. The others had ground</p>
<p>their task and had gone to take their rest,</p>
<p>but this one had not yet</p>
<p>finished,</p>
<p>for she was not so strong as they were,</p>
<p>and when she heard</p>
<p>the thunder she stopped grinding and gave the sign to her master.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou,</p>
<p>who rule over heaven and earth,</p>
<p>you have</p>
<p>thundered from a clear sky without so much as a cloud in it,</p>
<p>and this</p>
<p>means something for somebody; grant the prayer,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>of me your poor</p>
<p>servant who calls upon you,</p>
<p>and let this be the very last day that the</p>
<p>suitors dine in the house of Ulysses. They have worn me out with labour</p>
<p>of grinding meal for them,</p>
<p>and I hope they may never have another</p>
<p>dinner anywhere at all.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses was glad when he heard the omens conveyed to him by the woman‚Äôs</p>
<p>speech,</p>
<p>and by the thunder,</p>
<p>for he knew they meant that he should</p>
<p>avenge himself on the suitors.</p>
<p>Then the other maids in the house rose and lit the fire on the hearth;</p>
<p>Telemachus also rose and put on his clothes. He girded his sword about</p>
<p>his shoulder,</p>
<p>bound his sandals on to his comely feet,</p>
<p>and took a</p>
<p>doughty spear with a point of sharpened bronze; then he went to the</p>
<p>threshold of the cloister and said to Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNurse,</p>
<p>did you make</p>
<p>the stranger comfortable both as regards bed and board,</p>
<p>or did you let</p>
<p>him shift for himself?‚Äîfor my mother,</p>
<p>good woman though she is,</p>
<p>has a</p>
<p>way of paying great attention to second-rate people,</p>
<p>and of neglecting</p>
<p>others who are in reality much better men.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not find fault child,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhen there is no one to find</p>
<p>fault with. The stranger sat and drank his wine as long as he liked:</p>
<p>your mother did ask him if he would take any more bread and he said he</p>
<p>would not. When he wanted to go to bed she told the servants to make</p>
<p>one for him,</p>
<p>but he said he was such a wretched outcast that he would</p>
<p>not sleep on a bed and under blankets; he insisted on having an</p>
<p>undressed bullock‚Äôs hide and some sheepskins put for him in the</p>
<p>cloister and I threw a cloak over him myself.‚Äù157</p>
<p>Then Telemachus went out of the court to the place where the Achaeans</p>
<p>were meeting in assembly; he had his spear in his hand,</p>
<p>and he was not</p>
<p>alone,</p>
<p>for his two dogs went with him. But Euryclea called the maids</p>
<p>and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome,</p>
<p>wake up; set about sweeping the cloisters and</p>
<p>sprinkling them with water to lay the dust; put the covers on the</p>
<p>seats; wipe down the tables,</p>
<p>some of you,</p>
<p>with a wet sponge; clean out</p>
<p>the mixing-jugs and the cups,</p>
<p>and go for water from the fountain at</p>
<p>once; the suitors will be here directly; they will be here early,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>it is a feast day.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did she speak,</p>
<p>and they did even as she had said: twenty of them</p>
<p>went to the fountain for water,</p>
<p>and the others set themselves busily to</p>
<p>work about the house. The men who were in attendance on the suitors</p>
<p>also came up and began chopping firewood. By and by the women returned</p>
<p>from the fountain,</p>
<p>and the swineherd came after them with the three</p>
<p>best pigs he could pick out. These he let feed about the premises,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>then he said good-humouredly to Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>are the suitors</p>
<p>treating you any better now,</p>
<p>or are they as insolent as ever?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMay heaven,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúrequite to them the wickedness with</p>
<p>which they deal high-handedly in another man‚Äôs house without any sense</p>
<p>of shame.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse; meanwhile Melanthius the goatherd came up,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>he too was bringing in his best goats for the suitors‚Äô dinner; and he</p>
<p>had two shepherds with him. They tied the goats up under the gatehouse,</p>
<p>and then Melanthius began gibing at Ulysses. ‚ÄúAre you still here,</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúto pester people by begging about the house? Why</p>
<p>can you not go elsewhere? You and I shall not come to an understanding</p>
<p>before we have given each other a taste of our fists. You beg without</p>
<p>any sense of decency: are there not feasts elsewhere among the</p>
<p>Achaeans,</p>
<p>as well as here?‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses made no answer,</p>
<p>but bowed his head and brooded. Then a third</p>
<p>man,</p>
<p>Philoetius,</p>
<p>joined them,</p>
<p>who was bringing in a barren heifer and</p>
<p>some goats. These were brought over by the boatmen who are there to</p>
<p>take people over when any one comes to them. So Philoetius made his</p>
<p>heifer and his goats secure under the gatehouse,</p>
<p>and then went up to</p>
<p>the swineherd. ‚ÄúWho,</p>
<p>Swineherd,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúis this stranger that is</p>
<p>lately come here? Is he one of your men? What is his family? Where does</p>
<p>he come from? Poor fellow,</p>
<p>he looks as if he had been some great man,</p>
<p>but the gods give sorrow to whom they will‚Äîeven to kings if it so</p>
<p>pleases them.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he went up to Ulysses and saluted him with his right hand;</p>
<p>‚ÄúGood day to you,</p>
<p>father stranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou seem to be very</p>
<p>poorly off now,</p>
<p>but I hope you will have better times by and by. Father</p>
<p>Jove,</p>
<p>of all gods you are the most malicious. We are your own children,</p>
<p>yet you show us no mercy in all our misery and afflictions. A sweat</p>
<p>came over me when I saw this man,</p>
<p>and my eyes filled with tears,</p>
<p>for he</p>
<p>reminds me of Ulysses,</p>
<p>who I fear is going about in just such rags as</p>
<p>this man‚Äôs are,</p>
<p>if indeed he is still among the living. If he is</p>
<p>already dead and in the house of Hades,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>alas! for my good master,</p>
<p>who made me his stockman when I was quite young among the</p>
<p>Cephallenians,</p>
<p>and now his cattle are countless; no one could have done</p>
<p>better with them than I have,</p>
<p>for they have bred like ears of corn;</p>
<p>nevertheless I have to keep bringing them in for others to eat,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>take no heed to his son though he is in the house,</p>
<p>and fear not the</p>
<p>wrath of heaven,</p>
<p>but are already eager to divide Ulysses‚Äô property</p>
<p>among them because he has been away so long. I have often thought‚Äîonly</p>
<p>it would not be right while his son is living‚Äîof going off with the</p>
<p>cattle to some foreign country; bad as this would be,</p>
<p>it is still</p>
<p>harder to stay here and be ill-treated about other people‚Äôs herds. My</p>
<p>position is intolerable,</p>
<p>and I should long since have run away and put</p>
<p>myself under the protection of some other chief,</p>
<p>only that I believe my</p>
<p>poor master will yet return,</p>
<p>and send all these suitors flying out of</p>
<p>the house.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúStockman,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou seem to be a very well-disposed</p>
<p>person,</p>
<p>and I can see that you are a man of sense. Therefore I will</p>
<p>tell you,</p>
<p>and will confirm my words with an oath. By Jove,</p>
<p>the chief of</p>
<p>all gods,</p>
<p>and by that hearth of Ulysses to which I am now come,</p>
<p>Ulysses</p>
<p>shall return before you leave this place,</p>
<p>and if you are so minded you</p>
<p>shall see him killing the suitors who are now masters here.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf Jove were to bring this to pass,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied the stockman,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou should</p>
<p>see how I would do my very utmost to help him.‚Äù</p>
<p>And in like manner Eumaeus prayed that Ulysses might return home.</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile the suitors were hatching a plot to</p>
<p>murder Telemachus: but a bird flew near them on their left hand‚Äîan</p>
<p>eagle with a dove in its talons. On this Amphinomus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>this plot of ours to murder Telemachus will not succeed; let us go to</p>
<p>dinner instead.‚Äù</p>
<p>The others assented,</p>
<p>so they went inside and laid their cloaks on the</p>
<p>benches and seats. They sacrificed the sheep,</p>
<p>goats,</p>
<p>pigs,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>heifer,</p>
<p>and when the inward meats were cooked they served them round.</p>
<p>They mixed the wine in the mixing-bowls,</p>
<p>and the swineherd gave every</p>
<p>man his cup,</p>
<p>while Philoetius handed round the bread in the bread</p>
<p>baskets,</p>
<p>and Melanthius poured them out their wine. Then they laid</p>
<p>their hands upon the good things that were before them.</p>
<p>Telemachus purposely made Ulysses sit in the part of the cloister that</p>
<p>was paved with stone;158 he gave him a shabby looking seat at a little</p>
<p>table to himself,</p>
<p>and had his portion of the inward meats brought to</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>with his wine in a gold cup. ‚ÄúSit there,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúand drink your</p>
<p>wine among the great people. I will put a stop to the gibes and blows</p>
<p>of the suitors,</p>
<p>for this is no public house,</p>
<p>but belongs to Ulysses,</p>
<p>and has passed from him to me. Therefore,</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>keep your hands and</p>
<p>your tongues to yourselves,</p>
<p>or there will be mischief.‚Äù</p>
<p>The suitors bit their lips,</p>
<p>and marvelled at the boldness of his</p>
<p>speech; then Antinous said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe do not like such language but we will</p>
<p>put up with it,</p>
<p>for Telemachus is threatening us in good earnest. If</p>
<p>Jove had let us we should have put a stop to his brave talk ere now.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke Antinous,</p>
<p>but Telemachus heeded him not. Meanwhile the</p>
<p>heralds were bringing the holy hecatomb through the city,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>Achaeans gathered under the shady grove of Apollo.</p>
<p>Then they roasted the outer meat,</p>
<p>drew it off the spits,</p>
<p>gave every man</p>
<p>his portion,</p>
<p>and feasted to their heart‚Äôs content; those who waited at</p>
<p>table gave Ulysses exactly the same portion as the others had,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Telemachus had told them to do so.</p>
<p>But Minerva would not let the suitors for one moment drop their</p>
<p>insolence,</p>
<p>for she wanted Ulysses to become still more bitter against</p>
<p>them. Now there happened to be among them a ribald fellow,</p>
<p>whose name</p>
<p>was Ctesippus,</p>
<p>and who came from Same. This man,</p>
<p>confident in his great</p>
<p>wealth,</p>
<p>was paying court to the wife of Ulysses,</p>
<p>and said to the</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear what I have to say. The stranger has already had as</p>
<p>large a portion as any one else; this is well,</p>
<p>for it is not right nor</p>
<p>reasonable to ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes here. I will,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>make him a present on my own account,</p>
<p>that he may have</p>
<p>something to give to the bath-woman,</p>
<p>or to some other of Ulysses‚Äô</p>
<p>servants.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he picked up a heifer‚Äôs foot from the meat-basket in which</p>
<p>it lay,</p>
<p>and threw it at Ulysses,</p>
<p>but Ulysses turned his head a little</p>
<p>aside,</p>
<p>and avoided it,</p>
<p>smiling grimly Sardinian fashion159 as he did</p>
<p>so,</p>
<p>and it hit the wall,</p>
<p>not him. On this Telemachus spoke fiercely to</p>
<p>Ctesippus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is a good thing for you,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat the stranger</p>
<p>turned his head so that you missed him. If you had hit him I should</p>
<p>have run you through with my spear,</p>
<p>and your father would have had to</p>
<p>see about getting you buried rather than married in this house. So let</p>
<p>me have no more unseemly behaviour from any of you,</p>
<p>for I am grown up</p>
<p>now to the knowledge of good and evil and understand what is going on,</p>
<p>instead of being the child that I have been heretofore. I have long</p>
<p>seen you killing my sheep and making free with my corn and wine: I have</p>
<p>put up with this,</p>
<p>for one man is no match for many,</p>
<p>but do me no</p>
<p>further violence. Still,</p>
<p>if you wish to kill me,</p>
<p>kill me; I would far</p>
<p>rather die than see such disgraceful scenes day after day‚Äîguests</p>
<p>insulted,</p>
<p>and men dragging the women servants about the house in an</p>
<p>unseemly way.‚Äù</p>
<p>They all held their peace till at last Agelaus son of Damastor said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúNo one should take offence at what has just been said,</p>
<p>nor gainsay it,</p>
<p>for it is quite reasonable. Leave off,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>ill-treating the</p>
<p>stranger,</p>
<p>or any one else of the servants who are about the house; I</p>
<p>would say,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>a friendly word to Telemachus and his mother,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>I trust may commend itself to both. ‚ÄòAs long,</p>
<p>‚Äô I would say,</p>
<p>‚Äòas you had</p>
<p>ground for hoping that Ulysses would one day come home,</p>
<p>no one could</p>
<p>complain of your waiting and suffering160 the suitors to be in your</p>
<p>house. It would have been better that he should have returned,</p>
<p>but it</p>
<p>is now sufficiently clear that he will never do so; therefore talk all</p>
<p>this quietly over with your mother,</p>
<p>and tell her to marry the best man,</p>
<p>and the one who makes her the most advantageous offer. Thus you will</p>
<p>yourself be able to manage your own inheritance,</p>
<p>and to eat and drink</p>
<p>in peace,</p>
<p>while your mother will look after some other man‚Äôs house,</p>
<p>not</p>
<p>yours.‚Äô‚Äù</p>
<p>To this Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúBy Jove,</p>
<p>Agelaus,</p>
<p>and by the sorrows of</p>
<p>my unhappy father,</p>
<p>who has either perished far from Ithaca,</p>
<p>or is</p>
<p>wandering in some distant land,</p>
<p>I throw no obstacles in the way of my</p>
<p>mother‚Äôs marriage; on the contrary I urge her to choose whomsoever she</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>and I will give her numberless gifts into the bargain,</p>
<p>but I dare</p>
<p>not insist point blank that she shall leave the house against her own</p>
<p>wishes. Heaven forbid that I should do this.‚Äù</p>
<p>Minerva now made the suitors fall to laughing immoderately,</p>
<p>and set</p>
<p>their wits wandering; but they were laughing with a forced laughter.</p>
<p>Their meat became smeared with blood; their eyes filled with tears,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>their hearts were heavy with forebodings. Theoclymenus saw this and</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúUnhappy men,</p>
<p>what is it that ails you? There is a shroud of</p>
<p>darkness drawn over you from head to foot,</p>
<p>your cheeks are wet with</p>
<p>tears; the air is alive with wailing voices; the walls and roof-beams</p>
<p>drip blood; the gate of the cloisters and the court beyond them are</p>
<p>full of ghosts trooping down into the night of hell; the sun is blotted</p>
<p>out of heaven,</p>
<p>and a blighting gloom is over all the land.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they all of them laughed heartily. Eurymachus</p>
<p>then said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis stranger who has lately come here has lost his senses.</p>
<p>Servants,</p>
<p>turn him out into the streets,</p>
<p>since he finds it so dark</p>
<p>here.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Theoclymenus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurymachus,</p>
<p>you need not send any one with me.</p>
<p>I have eyes,</p>
<p>ears,</p>
<p>and a pair of feet of my own,</p>
<p>to say nothing of an</p>
<p>understanding mind. I will take these out of the house with me,</p>
<p>for I</p>
<p>see mischief overhanging you,</p>
<p>from which not one of you men who are</p>
<p>insulting people and plotting ill deeds in the house of Ulysses will be</p>
<p>able to escape.‚Äù</p>
<p>He left the house as he spoke,</p>
<p>and went back to Piraeus who gave him</p>
<p>welcome,</p>
<p>but the suitors kept looking at one another and provoking</p>
<p>Telemachus by laughing at the strangers. One insolent fellow said to</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>you are not happy in your guests; first you have this</p>
<p>importunate tramp,</p>
<p>who comes begging bread and wine and has no skill</p>
<p>for work or for hard fighting,</p>
<p>but is perfectly useless,</p>
<p>and now here</p>
<p>is another fellow who is setting himself up as a prophet. Let me</p>
<p>persuade you,</p>
<p>for it will be much better to put them on board ship and</p>
<p>send them off to the Sicels to sell for what they will bring.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus gave him no heed,</p>
<p>but sat silently watching his father,</p>
<p>expecting every moment that he would begin his attack upon the suitors.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the daughter of Icarius,</p>
<p>wise Penelope,</p>
<p>had had a rich seat</p>
<p>placed for her facing the court and cloisters,</p>
<p>so that she could hear</p>
<p>what every one was saying. The dinner indeed had been prepared amid</p>
<p>much merriment; it had been both good and abundant,</p>
<p>for they had</p>
<p>sacrificed many victims; but the supper was yet to come,</p>
<p>and nothing</p>
<p>can be conceived more gruesome than the meal which a goddess and a</p>
<p>brave man were soon to lay before them‚Äîfor they had brought their doom</p>
<p>upon themselves.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XXI</span>
<p>THE TRIAL OF THE AXES,</p>
<p>DURING WHICH ULYSSES REVEALS HIMSELF TO EUMAEUS</p>
<p>AND PHILOETIUS</p>
<p>Minerva now put it in Penelope‚Äôs mind to make the suitors try their</p>
<p>skill with the bow and with the iron axes,</p>
<p>in contest among themselves,</p>
<p>as a means of bringing about their destruction. She went upstairs and</p>
<p>got the store-room key,</p>
<p>which was made of bronze and had a handle of</p>
<p>ivory; she then went with her maidens into the store-room at the end of</p>
<p>the house,</p>
<p>where her husband‚Äôs treasures of gold,</p>
<p>bronze,</p>
<p>and wrought</p>
<p>iron were kept,</p>
<p>and where was also his bow,</p>
<p>and the quiver full of</p>
<p>deadly arrows that had been given him by a friend whom he had met in</p>
<p>Lacedaemon‚ÄîIphitus the son of Eurytus. The two fell in with one another</p>
<p>in Messene at the house of Ortilochus,</p>
<p>where Ulysses was staying in</p>
<p>order to recover a debt that was owing from the whole people; for the</p>
<p>Messenians had carried off three hundred sheep from Ithaca,</p>
<p>and had</p>
<p>sailed away with them and with their shepherds. In quest of these</p>
<p>Ulysses took a long journey while still quite young,</p>
<p>for his father and</p>
<p>the other chieftains sent him on a mission to recover them. Iphitus had</p>
<p>gone there also to try and get back twelve brood mares that he had</p>
<p>lost,</p>
<p>and the mule foals that were running with them. These mares were</p>
<p>the death of him in the end,</p>
<p>for when he went to the house of Jove‚Äôs</p>
<p>son,</p>
<p>mighty Hercules,</p>
<p>who performed such prodigies of valour,</p>
<p>Hercules</p>
<p>to his shame killed him,</p>
<p>though he was his guest,</p>
<p>for he feared not</p>
<p>heaven‚Äôs vengeance,</p>
<p>nor yet respected his own table which he had set</p>
<p>before Iphitus,</p>
<p>but killed him in spite of everything,</p>
<p>and kept the</p>
<p>mares himself. It was when claiming these that Iphitus met Ulysses,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>gave him the bow which mighty Eurytus had been used to carry,</p>
<p>and which</p>
<p>on his death had been left by him to his son. Ulysses gave him in</p>
<p>return a sword and a spear,</p>
<p>and this was the beginning of a fast</p>
<p>friendship,</p>
<p>although they never visited at one another‚Äôs houses,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>Jove‚Äôs son Hercules killed Iphitus ere they could do so. This bow,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>given him by Iphitus,</p>
<p>had not been taken with him by Ulysses when</p>
<p>he sailed for Troy; he had used it so long as he had been at home,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>had left it behind as having been a keepsake from a valued friend.</p>
<p>Penelope presently reached the oak threshold of the store-room; the</p>
<p>carpenter had planed this duly,</p>
<p>and had drawn a line on it so as to get</p>
<p>it quite straight; he had then set the door posts into it and hung the</p>
<p>doors. She loosed the strap from the handle of the door,</p>
<p>put in the</p>
<p>key,</p>
<p>and drove it straight home to shoot back the bolts that held the</p>
<p>doors;161 these flew open with a noise like a bull bellowing in a</p>
<p>meadow,</p>
<p>and Penelope stepped upon the raised platform,</p>
<p>where the chests</p>
<p>stood in which the fair linen and clothes were laid by along with</p>
<p>fragrant herbs: reaching thence,</p>
<p>she took down the bow with its bow</p>
<p>case from the peg on which it hung. She sat down with it on her knees,</p>
<p>weeping bitterly as she took the bow out of its case,</p>
<p>and when her</p>
<p>tears had relieved her,</p>
<p>she went to the cloister where the suitors</p>
<p>were,</p>
<p>carrying the bow and the quiver,</p>
<p>with the many deadly arrows that</p>
<p>were inside it. Along with her came her maidens,</p>
<p>bearing a chest that</p>
<p>contained much iron and bronze which her husband had won as prizes.</p>
<p>When she reached the suitors,</p>
<p>she stood by one of the bearing-posts</p>
<p>supporting the roof of the cloister,</p>
<p>holding a veil before her face,</p>
<p>and with a maid on either side of her. Then she said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúListen to me you suitors,</p>
<p>who persist in abusing the hospitality of</p>
<p>this house because its owner has been long absent,</p>
<p>and without other</p>
<p>pretext than that you want to marry me; this,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>being the prize</p>
<p>that you are contending for,</p>
<p>I will bring out the mighty bow of</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>and whomsoever of you shall string it most easily and send his</p>
<p>arrow through each one of twelve axes,</p>
<p>him will I follow and quit this</p>
<p>house of my lawful husband,</p>
<p>so goodly,</p>
<p>and so abounding in wealth. But</p>
<p>even so I doubt not that I shall remember it in my dreams.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke,</p>
<p>she told Eumaeus to set the bow and the pieces of iron</p>
<p>before the suitors,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus wept as he took them to do as she had</p>
<p>bidden him. Hard by,</p>
<p>the stockman wept also when he saw his master‚Äôs</p>
<p>bow,</p>
<p>but Antinous scolded them. ‚ÄúYou country louts,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúsilly</p>
<p>simpletons; why should you add to the sorrows of your mistress by</p>
<p>crying in this way? She has enough to grieve her in the loss of her</p>
<p>husband; sit still,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and eat your dinners in silence,</p>
<p>or go</p>
<p>outside if you want to cry,</p>
<p>and leave the bow behind you. We suitors</p>
<p>shall have to contend for it with might and main,</p>
<p>for we shall find it</p>
<p>no light matter to string such a bow as this is. There is not a man of</p>
<p>us all who is such another as Ulysses; for I have seen him and remember</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>though I was then only a child.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was what he said,</p>
<p>but all the time he was expecting to be able to</p>
<p>string the bow and shoot through the iron,</p>
<p>whereas in fact he was to be</p>
<p>the first that should taste of the arrows from the hands of Ulysses,</p>
<p>whom he was dishonouring in his own house‚Äîegging the others on to do so</p>
<p>also.</p>
<p>Then Telemachus spoke. ‚ÄúGreat heavens!‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚ÄúJove must have</p>
<p>robbed me of my senses. Here is my dear and excellent mother saying she</p>
<p>will quit this house and marry again,</p>
<p>yet I am laughing and enjoying</p>
<p>myself as though there were nothing happening. But,</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>as the</p>
<p>contest has been agreed upon,</p>
<p>let it go forward. It is for a woman</p>
<p>whose peer is not to be found in Pylos,</p>
<p>Argos,</p>
<p>or Mycene,</p>
<p>nor yet in</p>
<p>Ithaca nor on the mainland. You know this as well as I do; what need</p>
<p>have I to speak in praise of my mother? Come on,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>make no excuses</p>
<p>for delay,</p>
<p>but let us see whether you can string the bow or no. I too</p>
<p>will make trial of it,</p>
<p>for if I can string it and shoot through the</p>
<p>iron,</p>
<p>I shall not suffer my mother to quit this house with a stranger,</p>
<p>not if I can win the prizes which my father won before me.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he sprang from his seat,</p>
<p>threw his crimson cloak from him,</p>
<p>and took his sword from his shoulder. First he set the axes in a row,</p>
<p>in a long groove which he had dug for them,</p>
<p>and had made straight by</p>
<p>line.162 Then he stamped the earth tight round them,</p>
<p>and everyone was</p>
<p>surprised when they saw him set them up so orderly,</p>
<p>though he had never</p>
<p>seen anything of the kind before. This done,</p>
<p>he went on to the pavement</p>
<p>to make trial of the bow; thrice did he tug at it,</p>
<p>trying with all his</p>
<p>might to draw the string,</p>
<p>and thrice he had to leave off,</p>
<p>though he had</p>
<p>hoped to string the bow and shoot through the iron. He was trying for</p>
<p>the fourth time,</p>
<p>and would have strung it had not Ulysses made a sign</p>
<p>to check him in spite of all his eagerness. So he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúAlas! I shall either be always feeble and of no prowess,</p>
<p>or I am too</p>
<p>young,</p>
<p>and have not yet reached my full strength so as to be able to</p>
<p>hold my own if any one attacks me. You others,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>who are</p>
<p>stronger than I,</p>
<p>make trial of the bow and get this contest settled.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he put the bow down,</p>
<p>letting it lean against the door [that led</p>
<p>into the house] with the arrow standing against the top of the bow.</p>
<p>Then he sat down on the seat from which he had risen,</p>
<p>and Antinous</p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúCome on each of you in his turn,</p>
<p>going towards the right from the</p>
<p>place at which the cupbearer begins when he is handing round the wine.‚Äù</p>
<p>The rest agreed,</p>
<p>and Leiodes son of Oenops was the first to rise. He</p>
<p>was sacrificial priest to the suitors,</p>
<p>and sat in the corner near the</p>
<p>mixing-bowl. 163 He was the only man who hated their evil deeds and was</p>
<p>indignant with the others. He was now the first to take the bow and</p>
<p>arrow,</p>
<p>so he went on to the pavement to make his trial,</p>
<p>but he could</p>
<p>not string the bow,</p>
<p>for his hands were weak and unused to hard work,</p>
<p>they therefore soon grew tired,</p>
<p>and he said to the suitors,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy</p>
<p>friends,</p>
<p>I cannot string it; let another have it,</p>
<p>this bow shall take</p>
<p>the life and soul out of many a chief among us,</p>
<p>for it is better to die</p>
<p>than to live after having missed the prize that we have so long striven</p>
<p>for,</p>
<p>and which has brought us so long together. Some one of us is even</p>
<p>now hoping and praying that he may marry Penelope,</p>
<p>but when he has seen</p>
<p>this bow and tried it,</p>
<p>let him woo and make bridal offerings to some</p>
<p>other woman,</p>
<p>and let Penelope marry whoever makes her the best offer</p>
<p>and whose lot it is to win her.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he put the bow down,</p>
<p>letting it lean against the door,</p>
<p>164 with</p>
<p>the arrow standing against the tip of the bow. Then he took his seat</p>
<p>again on the seat from which he had risen; and Antinous rebuked him</p>
<p>saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúLeiodes,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? Your words are monstrous and</p>
<p>intolerable; it makes me angry to listen to you. Shall,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>this bow</p>
<p>take the life of many a chief among us,</p>
<p>merely because you cannot bend</p>
<p>it yourself? True,</p>
<p>you were not born to be an archer,</p>
<p>but there are</p>
<p>others who will soon string it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then he said to Melanthius the goatherd,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook sharp,</p>
<p>light a fire in</p>
<p>the court,</p>
<p>and set a seat hard by with a sheep skin on it; bring us</p>
<p>also a large ball of lard,</p>
<p>from what they have in the house. Let us</p>
<p>warm the bow and grease it‚Äîwe will then make trial of it again,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>bring the contest to an end.‚Äù</p>
<p>Melanthius lit the fire,</p>
<p>and set a seat covered with sheep skins beside</p>
<p>it. He also brought a great ball of lard from what they had in the</p>
<p>house,</p>
<p>and the suitors warmed the bow and again made trial of it,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>they were none of them nearly strong enough to string it. Nevertheless</p>
<p>there still remained Antinous and Eurymachus,</p>
<p>who were the ringleaders</p>
<p>among the suitors and much the foremost among them all.</p>
<p>Then the swineherd and the stockman left the cloisters together,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Ulysses followed them. When they had got outside the gates and the</p>
<p>outer yard,</p>
<p>Ulysses said to them quietly:</p>
<p>‚ÄúStockman,</p>
<p>and you swineherd,</p>
<p>I have something in my mind which I am in</p>
<p>doubt whether to say or no; but I think I will say it. What manner of</p>
<p>men would you be to stand by Ulysses,</p>
<p>if some god should bring him back</p>
<p>here all of a sudden? Say which you are disposed to do‚Äîto side with the</p>
<p>suitors,</p>
<p>or with Ulysses?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Jove,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered the stockman,</p>
<p>‚Äúwould indeed that you might so</p>
<p>ordain it. If some god were but to bring Ulysses back,</p>
<p>you should see</p>
<p>with what might and main I would fight for him.‚Äù</p>
<p>In like words Eumaeus prayed to all the gods that Ulysses might return;</p>
<p>when,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>he saw for certain what mind they were of,</p>
<p>Ulysses</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt is I,</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>who am here. I have suffered much,</p>
<p>but at</p>
<p>last,</p>
<p>in the twentieth year,</p>
<p>I am come back to my own country. I find</p>
<p>that you two alone of all my servants are glad that I should do so,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>I have not heard any of the others praying for my return. To you two,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>will I unfold the truth as it shall be. If heaven shall</p>
<p>deliver the suitors into my hands,</p>
<p>I will find wives for both of you,</p>
<p>will give you house and holding close to my own,</p>
<p>and you shall be to me</p>
<p>as though you were brothers and friends of Telemachus. I will now give</p>
<p>you convincing proofs that you may know me and be assured. See,</p>
<p>here is</p>
<p>the scar from the boar‚Äôs tooth that ripped me when I was out hunting on</p>
<p>Mt. Parnassus with the sons of Autolycus.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew his rags aside from the great scar,</p>
<p>and when they</p>
<p>had examined it thoroughly,</p>
<p>they both of them wept about Ulysses,</p>
<p>threw</p>
<p>their arms round him,</p>
<p>and kissed his head and shoulders,</p>
<p>while Ulysses</p>
<p>kissed their hands and faces in return. The sun would have gone down</p>
<p>upon their mourning if Ulysses had not checked them and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúCease your weeping,</p>
<p>lest some one should come outside and see us,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>tell those who are within. When you go in,</p>
<p>do so separately,</p>
<p>not both</p>
<p>together; I will go first,</p>
<p>and do you follow afterwards; let this</p>
<p>moreover be the token between us; the suitors will all of them try to</p>
<p>prevent me from getting hold of the bow and quiver; do you,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>place it in my hands when you are carrying it about,</p>
<p>and tell</p>
<p>the women to close the doors of their apartment. If they hear any</p>
<p>groaning or uproar as of men fighting about the house,</p>
<p>they must not</p>
<p>come out; they must keep quiet,</p>
<p>and stay where they are at their work.</p>
<p>And I charge you,</p>
<p>Philoetius,</p>
<p>to make fast the doors of the outer</p>
<p>court,</p>
<p>and to bind them securely at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>When he had thus spoken,</p>
<p>he went back to the house and took the seat</p>
<p>that he had left. Presently,</p>
<p>his two servants followed him inside.</p>
<p>At this moment the bow was in the hands of Eurymachus,</p>
<p>who was warming</p>
<p>it by the fire,</p>
<p>but even so he could not string it,</p>
<p>and he was greatly</p>
<p>grieved. He heaved a deep sigh and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI grieve for myself and for</p>
<p>us all; I grieve that I shall have to forgo the marriage,</p>
<p>but I do not</p>
<p>care nearly so much about this,</p>
<p>for there are plenty of other women in</p>
<p>Ithaca and elsewhere; what I feel most is the fact of our being so</p>
<p>inferior to Ulysses in strength that we cannot string his bow. This</p>
<p>will disgrace us in the eyes of those who are yet unborn.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt shall not be so,</p>
<p>Eurymachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Antinous,</p>
<p>‚Äúand you know it</p>
<p>yourself. Today is the feast of Apollo throughout all the land; who can</p>
<p>string a bow on such a day as this? Put it on one side‚Äîas for the axes</p>
<p>they can stay where they are,</p>
<p>for no one is likely to come to the house</p>
<p>and take them away: let the cupbearer go round with his cups,</p>
<p>that we</p>
<p>may make our drink-offerings and drop this matter of the bow; we will</p>
<p>tell Melanthius to bring us in some goats tomorrow‚Äîthe best he has; we</p>
<p>can then offer thigh bones to Apollo the mighty archer,</p>
<p>and again make</p>
<p>trial of the bow,</p>
<p>so as to bring the contest to an end.‚Äù</p>
<p>The rest approved his words,</p>
<p>and thereon men servants poured water over</p>
<p>the hands of the guests,</p>
<p>while pages filled the mixing-bowls with wine</p>
<p>and water and handed it round after giving every man his</p>
<p>drink-offering. Then,</p>
<p>when they had made their offerings and had drunk</p>
<p>each as much as he desired,</p>
<p>Ulysses craftily said:‚Äî</p>
<p>‚ÄúSuitors of the illustrious queen,</p>
<p>listen that I may speak even as I am</p>
<p>minded. I appeal more especially to Eurymachus,</p>
<p>and to Antinous who has</p>
<p>just spoken with so much reason. Cease shooting for the present and</p>
<p>leave the matter to the gods,</p>
<p>but in the morning let heaven give</p>
<p>victory to whom it will. For the moment,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>give me the bow that</p>
<p>I may prove the power of my hands among you all,</p>
<p>and see whether I</p>
<p>still have as much strength as I used to have,</p>
<p>or whether travel and</p>
<p>neglect have made an end of it.‚Äù</p>
<p>This made them all very angry,</p>
<p>for they feared he might string the bow,</p>
<p>Antinous therefore rebuked him fiercely saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWretched creature,</p>
<p>you</p>
<p>have not so much as a grain of sense in your whole body; you ought to</p>
<p>think yourself lucky in being allowed to dine unharmed among your</p>
<p>betters,</p>
<p>without having any smaller portion served you than we others</p>
<p>have had,</p>
<p>and in being allowed to hear our conversation. No other</p>
<p>beggar or stranger has been allowed to hear what we say among</p>
<p>ourselves; the wine must have been doing you a mischief,</p>
<p>as it does</p>
<p>with all those who drink immoderately. It was wine that inflamed the</p>
<p>Centaur Eurytion when he was staying with Peirithous among the</p>
<p>Lapithae. When the wine had got into his head,</p>
<p>he went mad and did ill</p>
<p>deeds about the house of Peirithous; this angered the heroes who were</p>
<p>there assembled,</p>
<p>so they rushed at him and cut off his ears and</p>
<p>nostrils; then they dragged him through the doorway out of the house,</p>
<p>so he went away crazed,</p>
<p>and bore the burden of his crime,</p>
<p>bereft of</p>
<p>understanding. Henceforth,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>there was war between mankind and</p>
<p>the centaurs,</p>
<p>but he brought it upon himself through his own</p>
<p>drunkenness. In like manner I can tell you that it will go hardly with</p>
<p>you if you string the bow: you will find no mercy from any one here,</p>
<p>for we shall at once ship you off to king Echetus,</p>
<p>who kills every one</p>
<p>that comes near him: you will never get away alive,</p>
<p>so drink and keep</p>
<p>quiet without getting into a quarrel with men younger than yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Penelope then spoke to him. ‚ÄúAntinous,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúit is not right that</p>
<p>you should ill-treat any guest of Telemachus who comes to this house.</p>
<p>If the stranger should prove strong enough to string the mighty bow of</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>can you suppose that he would take me home with him and make</p>
<p>me his wife? Even the man himself can have no such idea in his mind:</p>
<p>none of you need let that disturb his feasting; it would be out of all</p>
<p>reason.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúQueen Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Eurymachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúwe do not suppose that this man</p>
<p>will take you away with him; it is impossible; but we are afraid lest</p>
<p>some of the baser sort,</p>
<p>men or women among the Achaeans,</p>
<p>should go</p>
<p>gossiping about and say,</p>
<p>‚ÄòThese suitors are a feeble folk; they are</p>
<p>paying court to the wife of a brave man whose bow not one of them was</p>
<p>able to string,</p>
<p>and yet a beggarly tramp who came to the house strung</p>
<p>it at once and sent an arrow through the iron.‚Äô This is what will be</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>and it will be a scandal against us.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúEurymachus,</p>
<p>‚Äù Penelope answered,</p>
<p>‚Äúpeople who persist in eating up the</p>
<p>estate of a great chieftain and dishonouring his house must not expect</p>
<p>others to think well of them. Why then should you mind if men talk as</p>
<p>you think they will? This stranger is strong and well-built,</p>
<p>he says</p>
<p>moreover that he is of noble birth. Give him the bow,</p>
<p>and let us see</p>
<p>whether he can string it or no. I say‚Äîand it shall surely be‚Äîthat if</p>
<p>Apollo vouchsafes him the glory of stringing it,</p>
<p>I will give him a</p>
<p>cloak and shirt of good wear,</p>
<p>with a javelin to keep off dogs and</p>
<p>robbers,</p>
<p>and a sharp sword. I will also give him sandals,</p>
<p>and will see</p>
<p>him sent safely wherever he wants to go.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Telemachus said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMother,</p>
<p>I am the only man either in Ithaca or in</p>
<p>the islands that are over against Elis who has the right to let any one</p>
<p>have the bow or to refuse it. No one shall force me one way or the</p>
<p>other,</p>
<p>not even though I choose to make the stranger a present of the</p>
<p>bow outright,</p>
<p>and let him take it away with him. Go,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>within the</p>
<p>house and busy yourself with your daily duties,</p>
<p>your loom,</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>distaff,</p>
<p>and the ordering of your servants. This bow is a man‚Äôs matter,</p>
<p>and mine above all others,</p>
<p>for it is I who am master here.‚Äù</p>
<p>She went wondering back into the house,</p>
<p>and laid her son‚Äôs saying in</p>
<p>her heart. Then going upstairs with her handmaids into her room,</p>
<p>she</p>
<p>mourned her dear husband till Minerva sent sweet sleep over her</p>
<p>eyelids.</p>
<p>The swineherd now took up the bow and was for taking it to Ulysses,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>the suitors clamoured at him from all parts of the cloisters,</p>
<p>and one</p>
<p>of them said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou idiot,</p>
<p>where are you taking the bow to? Are you out</p>
<p>of your wits? If Apollo and the other gods will grant our prayer,</p>
<p>your</p>
<p>own boarhounds shall get you into some quiet little place,</p>
<p>and worry</p>
<p>you to death.‚Äù</p>
<p>Eumaeus was frightened at the outcry they all raised,</p>
<p>so he put the bow</p>
<p>down then and there,</p>
<p>but Telemachus shouted out at him from the other</p>
<p>side of the cloisters,</p>
<p>and threatened him saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather Eumaeus,</p>
<p>bring the bow on in spite of them,</p>
<p>or young as I am I will pelt you</p>
<p>with stones back to the country,</p>
<p>for I am the better man of the two. I</p>
<p>wish I was as much stronger than all the other suitors in the house as</p>
<p>I am than you,</p>
<p>I would soon send some of them off sick and sorry,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>they mean mischief.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they all of them laughed heartily,</p>
<p>which put</p>
<p>them in a better humour with Telemachus; so Eumaeus brought the bow on</p>
<p>and placed it in the hands of Ulysses. When he had done this,</p>
<p>he called</p>
<p>Euryclea apart and said to her,</p>
<p>‚ÄúEuryclea,</p>
<p>Telemachus says you are to</p>
<p>close the doors of the women‚Äôs apartments. If they hear any groaning or</p>
<p>uproar as of men fighting about the house,</p>
<p>they are not to come out,</p>
<p>but are to keep quiet and stay where they are at their work.‚Äù</p>
<p>Euryclea did as she was told and closed the doors of the women‚Äôs</p>
<p>apartments.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Philoetius slipped quietly out and made fast the gates of the</p>
<p>outer court. There was a ship‚Äôs cable of byblus fibre lying in the</p>
<p>gatehouse,</p>
<p>so he made the gates fast with it and then came in again,</p>
<p>resuming the seat that he had left,</p>
<p>and keeping an eye on Ulysses,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>had now got the bow in his hands,</p>
<p>and was turning it every way about,</p>
<p>and proving it all over to see whether the worms had been eating into</p>
<p>its two horns during his absence. Then would one turn towards his</p>
<p>neighbour saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis is some tricky old bow-fancier; either he has</p>
<p>got one like it at home,</p>
<p>or he wants to make one,</p>
<p>in such workmanlike</p>
<p>style does the old vagabond handle it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Another said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI hope he may be no more successful in other things than</p>
<p>he is likely to be in stringing this bow.‚Äù</p>
<p>But Ulysses,</p>
<p>when he had taken it up and examined it all over,</p>
<p>strung</p>
<p>it as easily as a skilled bard strings a new peg of his lyre and makes</p>
<p>the twisted gut fast at both ends. Then he took it in his right hand to</p>
<p>prove the string,</p>
<p>and it sang sweetly under his touch like the</p>
<p>twittering of a swallow. The suitors were dismayed,</p>
<p>and turned colour</p>
<p>as they heard it; at that moment,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>Jove thundered loudly as a</p>
<p>sign,</p>
<p>and the heart of Ulysses rejoiced as he heard the omen that the</p>
<p>son of scheming Saturn had sent him.</p>
<p>He took an arrow that was lying upon the table165‚Äîfor those which the</p>
<p>Achaeans were so shortly about to taste were all inside the quiver‚Äîhe</p>
<p>laid it on the centre-piece of the bow,</p>
<p>and drew the notch of the arrow</p>
<p>and the string toward him,</p>
<p>still seated on his seat. When he had taken</p>
<p>aim he let fly,</p>
<p>and his arrow pierced every one of the handle-holes of</p>
<p>the axes from the first onwards till it had gone right through them,</p>
<p>and into the outer courtyard. Then he said to Telemachus:</p>
<p>‚ÄúYour guest has not disgraced you,</p>
<p>Telemachus. I did not miss what I</p>
<p>aimed at,</p>
<p>and I was not long in stringing my bow. I am still strong,</p>
<p>and not as the suitors twit me with being. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>it is time for</p>
<p>the Achaeans to prepare supper while there is still daylight,</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p>otherwise to disport themselves with song and dance which are the</p>
<p>crowning ornaments of a banquet.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he made a sign with his eyebrows,</p>
<p>and Telemachus girded on</p>
<p>his sword,</p>
<p>grasped his spear,</p>
<p>and stood armed beside his father‚Äôs seat.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XXII</span>
<p>THE KILLING OF THE SUITORS‚ÄîTHE MAIDS WHO HAVE MISCONDUCTED THEMSELVES</p>
<p>ARE MADE TO CLEANSE THE CLOISTERS AND ARE THEN HANGED.</p>
<p>Then Ulysses tore off his rags,</p>
<p>and sprang on to the broad pavement</p>
<p>with his bow and his quiver full of arrows. He shed the arrows on to</p>
<p>the ground at his feet and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe mighty contest is at an end. I</p>
<p>will now see whether Apollo will vouchsafe it to me to hit another mark</p>
<p>which no man has yet hit.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this he aimed a deadly arrow at Antinous,</p>
<p>who was about to take up a</p>
<p>two-handled gold cup to drink his wine and already had it in his hands.</p>
<p>He had no thought of death‚Äîwho amongst all the revellers would think</p>
<p>that one man,</p>
<p>however brave,</p>
<p>would stand alone among so many and kill</p>
<p>him? The arrow struck Antinous in the throat,</p>
<p>and the point went clean</p>
<p>through his neck,</p>
<p>so that he fell over and the cup dropped from his</p>
<p>hand,</p>
<p>while a thick stream of blood gushed from his nostrils. He kicked</p>
<p>the table from him and upset the things on it,</p>
<p>so that the bread and</p>
<p>roasted meats were all soiled as they fell over on to the ground.166</p>
<p>The suitors were in an uproar when they saw that a man had been hit;</p>
<p>they sprang in dismay one and all of them from their seats and looked</p>
<p>everywhere towards the walls,</p>
<p>but there was neither shield nor spear,</p>
<p>and they rebuked Ulysses very angrily. ‚ÄúStranger,</p>
<p>‚Äù said they,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou</p>
<p>shall pay for shooting people in this way: you shall see no other</p>
<p>contest; you are a doomed man; he whom you have slain was the foremost</p>
<p>youth in Ithaca,</p>
<p>and the vultures shall devour you for having killed</p>
<p>him.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus they spoke,</p>
<p>for they thought that he had killed Antinous by</p>
<p>mistake,</p>
<p>and did not perceive that death was hanging over the head of</p>
<p>every one of them. But Ulysses glared at them and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúDogs,</p>
<p>did you think that I should not come back from Troy? You have</p>
<p>wasted my substance,</p>
<p>167 have forced my women servants to lie with you,</p>
<p>and have wooed my wife while I was still living. You have feared</p>
<p>neither God nor man,</p>
<p>and now you shall die.‚Äù</p>
<p>They turned pale with fear as he spoke,</p>
<p>and every man looked round</p>
<p>about to see whither he might fly for safety,</p>
<p>but Eurymachus alone</p>
<p>spoke.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you are Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúthen what you have said is just. We</p>
<p>have done much wrong on your lands and in your house. But Antinous who</p>
<p>was the head and front of the offending lies low already. It was all</p>
<p>his doing. It was not that he wanted to marry Penelope; he did not so</p>
<p>much care about that; what he wanted was something quite different,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Jove has not vouchsafed it to him; he wanted to kill your son and to be</p>
<p>chief man in Ithaca. Now,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>that he has met the death which</p>
<p>was his due,</p>
<p>spare the lives of your people. We will make everything</p>
<p>good among ourselves,</p>
<p>and pay you in full for all that we have eaten</p>
<p>and drunk. Each one of us shall pay you a fine worth twenty oxen,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>we will keep on giving you gold and bronze till your heart is softened.</p>
<p>Until we have done this no one can complain of your being enraged</p>
<p>against us.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses again glared at him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThough you should give me all</p>
<p>that you have in the world both now and all that you ever shall have,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>will not stay my hand till I have paid all of you in full. You must</p>
<p>fight,</p>
<p>or fly for your lives; and fly,</p>
<p>not a man of you shall.‚Äù</p>
<p>Their hearts sank as they heard him,</p>
<p>but Eurymachus again spoke saying:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>this man will give us no quarter. He will stand where he</p>
<p>is and shoot us down till he has killed every man among us. Let us then</p>
<p>show fight; draw your swords,</p>
<p>and hold up the tables to shield you from</p>
<p>his arrows. Let us have at him with a rush,</p>
<p>to drive him from the</p>
<p>pavement and doorway: we can then get through into the town,</p>
<p>and raise</p>
<p>such an alarm as shall soon stay his shooting.‚Äù</p>
<p>As he spoke he drew his keen blade of bronze,</p>
<p>sharpened on both sides,</p>
<p>and with a loud cry sprang towards Ulysses,</p>
<p>but Ulysses instantly shot</p>
<p>an arrow into his breast that caught him by the nipple and fixed itself</p>
<p>in his liver. He dropped his sword and fell doubled up over his table.</p>
<p>The cup and all the meats went over on to the ground as he smote the</p>
<p>earth with his forehead in the agonies of death,</p>
<p>and he kicked the</p>
<p>stool with his feet until his eyes were closed in darkness.</p>
<p>Then Amphinomus drew his sword and made straight at Ulysses to try and</p>
<p>get him away from the door; but Telemachus was too quick for him,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>struck him from behind; the spear caught him between the shoulders and</p>
<p>went right through his chest,</p>
<p>so that he fell heavily to the ground and</p>
<p>struck the earth with his forehead. Then Telemachus sprang away from</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>leaving his spear still in the body,</p>
<p>for he feared that if he</p>
<p>stayed to draw it out,</p>
<p>some one of the Achaeans might come up and hack</p>
<p>at him with his sword,</p>
<p>or knock him down,</p>
<p>so he set off at a run,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>immediately was at his father‚Äôs side. Then he said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>let me bring you a shield,</p>
<p>two spears,</p>
<p>and a brass helmet for</p>
<p>your temples. I will arm myself as well,</p>
<p>and will bring other armour</p>
<p>for the swineherd and the stockman,</p>
<p>for we had better be armed.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúRun and fetch them,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhile my arrows hold out,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>when I am alone they may get me away from the door.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus did as his father said,</p>
<p>and went off to the store room where</p>
<p>the armour was kept. He chose four shields,</p>
<p>eight spears,</p>
<p>and four</p>
<p>brass helmets with horse-hair plumes. He brought them with all speed to</p>
<p>his father,</p>
<p>and armed himself first,</p>
<p>while the stockman and the</p>
<p>swineherd also put on their armour,</p>
<p>and took their places near Ulysses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Ulysses,</p>
<p>as long as his arrows lasted,</p>
<p>had been shooting the</p>
<p>suitors one by one,</p>
<p>and they fell thick on one another: when his arrows</p>
<p>gave out,</p>
<p>he set the bow to stand against the end wall of the house by</p>
<p>the door post,</p>
<p>and hung a shield four hides thick about his shoulders;</p>
<p>on his comely head he set his helmet,</p>
<p>well wrought with a crest of</p>
<p>horse-hair that nodded menacingly above it,</p>
<p>168 and he grasped two</p>
<p>redoubtable bronze-shod spears.</p>
<p>Now there was a trap door169 on the wall,</p>
<p>while at one end of the</p>
<p>pavement170 there was an exit leading to a narrow passage,</p>
<p>and this</p>
<p>exit was closed by a well-made door. Ulysses told Philoetius to stand</p>
<p>by this door and guard it,</p>
<p>for only one person could attack it at a</p>
<p>time. But Agelaus shouted out,</p>
<p>‚ÄúCannot some one go up to the trap door</p>
<p>and tell the people what is going on? Help would come at once,</p>
<p>and we</p>
<p>should soon make an end of this man and his shooting.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúThis may not be,</p>
<p>Agelaus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Melanthius,</p>
<p>‚Äúthe mouth of the</p>
<p>narrow passage is dangerously near the entrance to the outer court. One</p>
<p>brave man could prevent any number from getting in. But I know what I</p>
<p>will do,</p>
<p>I will bring you arms from the store-room,</p>
<p>for I am sure it is</p>
<p>there that Ulysses and his son have put them.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the goatherd Melanthius went by back passages to the store-room</p>
<p>of Ulysses‚Äô house. There he chose twelve shields,</p>
<p>with as many helmets</p>
<p>and spears,</p>
<p>and brought them back as fast as he could to give them to</p>
<p>the suitors. Ulysses‚Äô heart began to fail him when he saw the</p>
<p>suitors171 putting on their armour and brandishing their spears. He saw</p>
<p>the greatness of the danger,</p>
<p>and said to Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome one of the</p>
<p>women inside is helping the suitors against us,</p>
<p>or it may be</p>
<p>Melanthius.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúThe fault,</p>
<p>father,</p>
<p>is mine,</p>
<p>and mine only; I left</p>
<p>the store room door open,</p>
<p>and they have kept a sharper look out than I</p>
<p>have. Go,</p>
<p>Eumaeus,</p>
<p>put the door to,</p>
<p>and see whether it is one of the</p>
<p>women who is doing this,</p>
<p>or whether,</p>
<p>as I suspect,</p>
<p>it is Melanthius the</p>
<p>son of Dolius.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Melanthius was again going to the</p>
<p>store room to fetch more armour,</p>
<p>but the swineherd saw him and said to</p>
<p>Ulysses who was beside him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>it is that</p>
<p>scoundrel Melanthius,</p>
<p>just as we suspected,</p>
<p>who is going to the store</p>
<p>room. Say,</p>
<p>shall I kill him,</p>
<p>if I can get the better of him,</p>
<p>or shall I</p>
<p>bring him here that you may take your own revenge for all the many</p>
<p>wrongs that he has done in your house?‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus and I will hold these suitors in check,</p>
<p>no matter what they do; go back both of you and bind Melanthius‚Äô hands</p>
<p>and feet behind him. Throw him into the store room and make the door</p>
<p>fast behind you; then fasten a noose about his body,</p>
<p>and string him</p>
<p>close up to the rafters from a high bearing-post,</p>
<p>172 that he may linger</p>
<p>on in an agony.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they did even as he had said; they went to the</p>
<p>store room,</p>
<p>which they entered before Melanthius saw them,</p>
<p>for he was</p>
<p>busy searching for arms in the innermost part of the room,</p>
<p>so the two</p>
<p>took their stand on either side of the door and waited. By and by</p>
<p>Melanthius came out with a helmet in one hand,</p>
<p>and an old dry-rotted</p>
<p>shield in the other,</p>
<p>which had been borne by Laertes when he was young,</p>
<p>but which had been long since thrown aside,</p>
<p>and the straps had become</p>
<p>unsewn; on this the two seized him,</p>
<p>dragged him back by the hair,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>threw him struggling to the ground. They bent his hands and feet well</p>
<p>behind his back,</p>
<p>and bound them tight with a painful bond as Ulysses</p>
<p>had told them; then they fastened a noose about his body and strung him</p>
<p>up from a high pillar till he was close up to the rafters,</p>
<p>and over him</p>
<p>did you then vaunt,</p>
<p>O swineherd Eumaeus saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMelanthius,</p>
<p>you will</p>
<p>pass the night on a soft bed as you deserve. You will know very well</p>
<p>when morning comes from the streams of Oceanus,</p>
<p>and it is time for you</p>
<p>to be driving in your goats for the suitors to feast on.‚Äù</p>
<p>There,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>they left him in very cruel bondage,</p>
<p>and having put on</p>
<p>their armour they closed the door behind them and went back to take</p>
<p>their places by the side of Ulysses; whereon the four men stood in the</p>
<p>cloister,</p>
<p>fierce and full of fury; nevertheless,</p>
<p>those who were in the</p>
<p>body of the court were still both brave and many. Then Jove‚Äôs daughter</p>
<p>Minerva came up to them,</p>
<p>having assumed the voice and form of Mentor.</p>
<p>Ulysses was glad when he saw her and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMentor,</p>
<p>lend me your help,</p>
<p>and forget not your old comrade,</p>
<p>nor the many good turns he has done</p>
<p>you. Besides,</p>
<p>you are my age-mate.‚Äù</p>
<p>But all the time he felt sure it was Minerva,</p>
<p>and the suitors from the</p>
<p>other side raised an uproar when they saw her. Agelaus was the first to</p>
<p>reproach her. ‚ÄúMentor,</p>
<p>‚Äù he cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not let Ulysses beguile you into</p>
<p>siding with him and fighting the suitors. This is what we will do: when</p>
<p>we have killed these people,</p>
<p>father and son,</p>
<p>we will kill you too. You</p>
<p>shall pay for it with your head,</p>
<p>and when we have killed you,</p>
<p>we will</p>
<p>take all you have,</p>
<p>in doors or out,</p>
<p>and bring it into hotch-pot with</p>
<p>Ulysses‚Äô property; we will not let your sons live in your house,</p>
<p>nor</p>
<p>your daughters,</p>
<p>nor shall your widow continue to live in the city of</p>
<p>Ithaca.‚Äù</p>
<p>This made Minerva still more furious,</p>
<p>so she scolded Ulysses very</p>
<p>angrily.173 ‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúyour strength and prowess are no</p>
<p>longer what they were when you fought for nine long years among the</p>
<p>Trojans about the noble lady Helen. You killed many a man in those</p>
<p>days,</p>
<p>and it was through your stratagem that Priam‚Äôs city was taken.</p>
<p>How comes it that you are so lamentably less valiant now that you are</p>
<p>on your own ground,</p>
<p>face to face with the suitors in your own house?</p>
<p>Come on,</p>
<p>my good fellow,</p>
<p>stand by my side and see how Mentor,</p>
<p>son of</p>
<p>Alcimus shall fight your foes and requite your kindnesses conferred</p>
<p>upon him.‚Äù</p>
<p>But she would not give him full victory as yet,</p>
<p>for she wished still</p>
<p>further to prove his own prowess and that of his brave son,</p>
<p>so she flew</p>
<p>up to one of the rafters in the roof of the cloister and sat upon it in</p>
<p>the form of a swallow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Agelaus son of Damastor,</p>
<p>Eurynomus,</p>
<p>Amphimedon,</p>
<p>Demoptolemus,</p>
<p>Pisander,</p>
<p>and Polybus son of Polyctor bore the brunt of the fight upon</p>
<p>the suitors‚Äô side; of all those who were still fighting for their lives</p>
<p>they were by far the most valiant,</p>
<p>for the others had already fallen</p>
<p>under the arrows of Ulysses. Agelaus shouted to them and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy</p>
<p>friends,</p>
<p>he will soon have to leave off,</p>
<p>for Mentor has gone away after</p>
<p>having done nothing for him but brag. They are standing at the doors</p>
<p>unsupported. Do not aim at him all at once,</p>
<p>but six of you throw your</p>
<p>spears first,</p>
<p>and see if you cannot cover yourselves with glory by</p>
<p>killing him. When he has fallen we need not be uneasy about the</p>
<p>others.‚Äù</p>
<p>They threw their spears as he bade them,</p>
<p>but Minerva made them all of</p>
<p>no effect. One hit the door post; another went against the door; the</p>
<p>pointed shaft of another struck the wall; and as soon as they had</p>
<p>avoided all the spears of the suitors Ulysses said to his own men,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy</p>
<p>friends,</p>
<p>I should say we too had better let drive into the middle of</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>or they will crown all the harm they have done us by killing us</p>
<p>outright.‚Äù</p>
<p>They therefore aimed straight in front of them and threw their spears.</p>
<p>Ulysses killed Demoptolemus,</p>
<p>Telemachus Euryades,</p>
<p>Eumaeus Elatus,</p>
<p>while</p>
<p>the stockman killed Pisander. These all bit the dust,</p>
<p>and as the others</p>
<p>drew back into a corner Ulysses and his men rushed forward and regained</p>
<p>their spears by drawing them from the bodies of the dead.</p>
<p>The suitors now aimed a second time,</p>
<p>but again Minerva made their</p>
<p>weapons for the most part without effect. One hit a bearing-post of the</p>
<p>cloister; another went against the door; while the pointed shaft of</p>
<p>another struck the wall. Still,</p>
<p>Amphimedon just took a piece of the top</p>
<p>skin from off Telemachus‚Äôs wrist,</p>
<p>and Ctesippus managed to graze</p>
<p>Eumaeus‚Äôs shoulder above his shield; but the spear went on and fell to</p>
<p>the ground. Then Ulysses and his men let drive into the crowd of</p>
<p>suitors. Ulysses hit Eurydamas,</p>
<p>Telemachus Amphimedon,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus</p>
<p>Polybus. After this the stockman hit Ctesippus in the breast,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>taunted him saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFoul-mouthed son of Polytherses,</p>
<p>do not be so</p>
<p>foolish as to talk wickedly another time,</p>
<p>but let heaven direct your</p>
<p>speech,</p>
<p>for the gods are far stronger than men. I make you a present of</p>
<p>this advice to repay you for the foot which you gave Ulysses when he</p>
<p>was begging about in his own house.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke the stockman,</p>
<p>and Ulysses struck the son of Damastor with a</p>
<p>spear in close fight,</p>
<p>while Telemachus hit Leocritus son of Evenor in</p>
<p>the belly,</p>
<p>and the dart went clean through him,</p>
<p>so that he fell forward</p>
<p>full on his face upon the ground. Then Minerva from her seat on the</p>
<p>rafter held up her deadly aegis,</p>
<p>and the hearts of the suitors quailed.</p>
<p>They fled to the other end of the court like a herd of cattle maddened</p>
<p>by the gadfly in early summer when the days are at their longest. As</p>
<p>eagle-beaked,</p>
<p>crook-taloned vultures from the mountains swoop down on</p>
<p>the smaller birds that cower in flocks upon the ground,</p>
<p>and kill them,</p>
<p>for they cannot either fight or fly,</p>
<p>and lookers on enjoy the</p>
<p>sport‚Äîeven so did Ulysses and his men fall upon the suitors and smite</p>
<p>them on every side. They made a horrible groaning as their brains were</p>
<p>being battered in,</p>
<p>and the ground seethed with their blood.</p>
<p>Leiodes then caught the knees of Ulysses and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses I beseech</p>
<p>you have mercy upon me and spare me. I never wronged any of the women</p>
<p>in your house either in word or deed,</p>
<p>and I tried to stop the others. I</p>
<p>saw them,</p>
<p>but they would not listen,</p>
<p>and now they are paying for their</p>
<p>folly. I was their sacrificing priest; if you kill me,</p>
<p>I shall die</p>
<p>without having done anything to deserve it,</p>
<p>and shall have got no</p>
<p>thanks for all the good that I did.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses looked sternly at him and answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you were their</p>
<p>sacrificing priest,</p>
<p>you must have prayed many a time that it might be</p>
<p>long before I got home again,</p>
<p>and that you might marry my wife and have</p>
<p>children by her. Therefore you shall die.‚Äù</p>
<p>With these words he picked up the sword that Agelaus had dropped when</p>
<p>he was being killed,</p>
<p>and which was lying upon the ground. Then he</p>
<p>struck Leiodes on the back of his neck,</p>
<p>so that his head fell rolling</p>
<p>in the dust while he was yet speaking.</p>
<p>The minstrel Phemius son of Terpes‚Äîhe who had been forced by the</p>
<p>suitors to sing to them‚Äînow tried to save his life. He was standing</p>
<p>near towards the trap door,</p>
<p>174 and held his lyre in his hand. He did</p>
<p>not know whether to fly out of the cloister and sit down by the altar</p>
<p>of Jove that was in the outer court,</p>
<p>and on which both Laertes and</p>
<p>Ulysses had offered up the thigh bones of many an ox,</p>
<p>or whether to go</p>
<p>straight up to Ulysses and embrace his knees,</p>
<p>but in the end he deemed</p>
<p>it best to embrace Ulysses‚Äô knees. So he laid his lyre on the ground</p>
<p>between the mixing bowl 175 and the silver-studded seat; then going up</p>
<p>to Ulysses he caught hold of his knees and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>I beseech</p>
<p>you have mercy on me and spare me. You will be sorry for it afterwards</p>
<p>if you kill a bard who can sing both for gods and men as I can. I make</p>
<p>all my lays myself,</p>
<p>and heaven visits me with every kind of</p>
<p>inspiration. I would sing to you as though you were a god,</p>
<p>do not</p>
<p>therefore be in such a hurry to cut my head off. Your own son</p>
<p>Telemachus will tell you that I did not want to frequent your house and</p>
<p>sing to the suitors after their meals,</p>
<p>but they were too many and too</p>
<p>strong for me,</p>
<p>so they made me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus heard him,</p>
<p>and at once went up to his father. ‚ÄúHold!‚Äù he</p>
<p>cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúthe man is guiltless,</p>
<p>do him no hurt; and we will spare Medon</p>
<p>too,</p>
<p>who was always good to me when I was a boy,</p>
<p>unless Philoetius or</p>
<p>Eumaeus has already killed him,</p>
<p>or he has fallen in your way when you</p>
<p>were raging about the court.‚Äù</p>
<p>Medon caught these words of Telemachus,</p>
<p>for he was crouching under a</p>
<p>seat beneath which he had hidden by covering himself up with a freshly</p>
<p>flayed heifer‚Äôs hide,</p>
<p>so he threw off the hide,</p>
<p>went up to Telemachus,</p>
<p>and laid hold of his knees.</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere I am,</p>
<p>my dear sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äústay your hand therefore,</p>
<p>and tell</p>
<p>your father,</p>
<p>or he will kill me in his rage against the suitors for</p>
<p>having wasted his substance and been so foolishly disrespectful to</p>
<p>yourself.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses smiled at him and answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFear not; Telemachus has saved</p>
<p>your life,</p>
<p>that you may know in future,</p>
<p>and tell other people,</p>
<p>how</p>
<p>greatly better good deeds prosper than evil ones. Go,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>outside the cloisters into the outer court,</p>
<p>and be out of the way of</p>
<p>the slaughter‚Äîyou and the bard‚Äîwhile I finish my work here inside.‚Äù</p>
<p>The pair went into the outer court as fast as they could,</p>
<p>and sat down</p>
<p>by Jove‚Äôs great altar,</p>
<p>looking fearfully round,</p>
<p>and still expecting</p>
<p>that they would be killed. Then Ulysses searched the whole court</p>
<p>carefully over,</p>
<p>to see if anyone had managed to hide himself and was</p>
<p>still living,</p>
<p>but he found them all lying in the dust and weltering in</p>
<p>their blood. They were like fishes which fishermen have netted out of</p>
<p>the sea,</p>
<p>and thrown upon the beach to lie gasping for water till the</p>
<p>heat of the sun makes an end of them. Even so were the suitors lying</p>
<p>all huddled up one against the other.</p>
<p>Then Ulysses said to Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúCall nurse Euryclea; I have something</p>
<p>to say to her.‚Äù</p>
<p>Telemachus went and knocked at the door of the women‚Äôs room. ‚ÄúMake</p>
<p>haste,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou old woman who have been set over all the other</p>
<p>women in the house. Come outside; my father wishes to speak to you.‚Äù</p>
<p>When Euryclea heard this she unfastened the door of the women‚Äôs room</p>
<p>and came out,</p>
<p>following Telemachus. She found Ulysses among the corpses</p>
<p>bespattered with blood and filth like a lion that has just been</p>
<p>devouring an ox,</p>
<p>and his breast and both his cheeks are all bloody,</p>
<p>so</p>
<p>that he is a fearful sight; even so was Ulysses besmirched from head to</p>
<p>foot with gore. When she saw all the corpses and such a quantity of</p>
<p>blood,</p>
<p>she was beginning to cry out for joy,</p>
<p>for she saw that a great</p>
<p>deed had been done; but Ulysses checked her,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld woman,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúrejoice in silence; restrain yourself,</p>
<p>and do not make any noise about</p>
<p>it; it is an unholy thing to vaunt over dead men. Heaven‚Äôs doom and</p>
<p>their own evil deeds have brought these men to destruction,</p>
<p>for they</p>
<p>respected no man in the whole world,</p>
<p>neither rich nor poor,</p>
<p>who came</p>
<p>near them,</p>
<p>and they have come to a bad end as a punishment for their</p>
<p>wickedness and folly. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>tell me which of the women in the</p>
<p>house have misconducted themselves,</p>
<p>and who are innocent.‚Äù176</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you the truth,</p>
<p>my son,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea. ‚ÄúThere are</p>
<p>fifty women in the house whom we teach to do things,</p>
<p>such as carding</p>
<p>wool,</p>
<p>and all kinds of household work. Of these,</p>
<p>twelve in all177 have</p>
<p>misbehaved,</p>
<p>and have been wanting in respect to me,</p>
<p>and also to</p>
<p>Penelope. They showed no disrespect to Telemachus,</p>
<p>for he has only</p>
<p>lately grown and his mother never permitted him to give orders to the</p>
<p>female servants; but let me go upstairs and tell your wife all that has</p>
<p>happened,</p>
<p>for some god has been sending her to sleep.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúDo not wake her yet,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúbut tell the women who have</p>
<p>misconducted themselves to come to me.‚Äù</p>
<p>Euryclea left the cloister to tell the women,</p>
<p>and make them come to</p>
<p>Ulysses; in the meantime he called Telemachus,</p>
<p>the stockman,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>swineherd. ‚ÄúBegin,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúto remove the dead,</p>
<p>and make the women</p>
<p>help you. Then,</p>
<p>get sponges and clean water to swill down the tables</p>
<p>and seats. When you have thoroughly cleansed the whole cloisters,</p>
<p>take</p>
<p>the women into the space between the domed room and the wall of the</p>
<p>outer court,</p>
<p>and run them through with your swords till they are quite</p>
<p>dead,</p>
<p>and have forgotten all about love and the way in which they used</p>
<p>to lie in secret with the suitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this the women came down in a body,</p>
<p>weeping and wailing bitterly.</p>
<p>First they carried the dead bodies out,</p>
<p>and propped them up against one</p>
<p>another in the gatehouse. Ulysses ordered them about and made them do</p>
<p>their work quickly,</p>
<p>so they had to carry the bodies out. When they had</p>
<p>done this,</p>
<p>they cleaned all the tables and seats with sponges and</p>
<p>water,</p>
<p>while Telemachus and the two others shovelled up the blood and</p>
<p>dirt from the ground,</p>
<p>and the women carried it all away and put it out</p>
<p>of doors. Then when they had made the whole place quite clean and</p>
<p>orderly,</p>
<p>they took the women out and hemmed them in the narrow space</p>
<p>between the wall of the domed room and that of the yard,</p>
<p>so that they</p>
<p>could not get away: and Telemachus said to the other two,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI shall not</p>
<p>let these women die a clean death,</p>
<p>for they were insolent to me and my</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>and used to sleep with the suitors.‚Äù</p>
<p>So saying he made a ship‚Äôs cable fast to one of the bearing-posts that</p>
<p>supported the roof of the domed room,</p>
<p>and secured it all around the</p>
<p>building,</p>
<p>at a good height,</p>
<p>lest any of the women‚Äôs feet should touch</p>
<p>the ground; and as thrushes or doves beat against a net that has been</p>
<p>set for them in a thicket just as they were getting to their nest,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>a terrible fate awaits them,</p>
<p>even so did the women have to put their</p>
<p>heads in nooses one after the other and die most miserably.178 Their</p>
<p>feet moved convulsively for a while,</p>
<p>but not for very long.</p>
<p>As for Melanthius,</p>
<p>they took him through the cloister into the inner</p>
<p>court. There they cut off his nose and his ears; they drew out his</p>
<p>vitals and gave them to the dogs raw,</p>
<p>and then in their fury they cut</p>
<p>off his hands and his feet.</p>
<p>When they had done this they washed their hands and feet and went back</p>
<p>into the house,</p>
<p>for all was now over; and Ulysses said to the dear old</p>
<p>nurse Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚ÄúBring me sulphur,</p>
<p>which cleanses all pollution,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>fetch fire also that I may burn it,</p>
<p>and purify the cloisters. Go,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>and tell Penelope to come here with her attendants,</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>all the maidservants that are in the house.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúAll that you have said is true,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚Äúbut let me bring</p>
<p>you some clean clothes‚Äîa shirt and cloak. Do not keep these rags on</p>
<p>your back any longer. It is not right.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirst light me a fire,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Ulysses.</p>
<p>She brought the fire and sulphur,</p>
<p>as he had bidden her,</p>
<p>and Ulysses</p>
<p>thoroughly purified the cloisters and both the inner and outer courts.</p>
<p>Then she went inside to call the women and tell them what had happened;</p>
<p>whereon they came from their apartment with torches in their hands,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>pressed round Ulysses to embrace him,</p>
<p>kissing his head and shoulders</p>
<p>and taking hold of his hands. It made him feel as if he should like to</p>
<p>weep,</p>
<p>for he remembered every one of them.179</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XXIII</span>
<p>PENELOPE EVENTUALLY RECOGNISES HER HUSBAND‚ÄîEARLY IN THE MORNING</p>
<p>ULYSSES,</p>
<p>TELEMACHUS,</p>
<p>EUMAEUS,</p>
<p>AND PHILOETIUS LEAVE THE TOWN.</p>
<p>Euryclea now went upstairs laughing to tell her mistress that her dear</p>
<p>husband had come home. Her aged knees became young again and her feet</p>
<p>were nimble for joy as she went up to her mistress and bent over her</p>
<p>head to speak to her. ‚ÄúWake up Penelope,</p>
<p>my dear child,</p>
<p>‚Äù she exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúand see with your own eyes something that you have been wanting this</p>
<p>long time past. Ulysses has at last indeed come home again,</p>
<p>and has</p>
<p>killed the suitors who were giving so much trouble in his house,</p>
<p>eating</p>
<p>up his estate and ill treating his son.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy good nurse,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou must be mad. The gods</p>
<p>sometimes send some very sensible people out of their minds,</p>
<p>and make</p>
<p>foolish people become sensible. This is what they must have been doing</p>
<p>to you; for you always used to be a reasonable person. Why should you</p>
<p>thus mock me when I have trouble enough already‚Äîtalking such nonsense,</p>
<p>and waking me up out of a sweet sleep that had taken possession of my</p>
<p>eyes and closed them? I have never slept so soundly from the day my</p>
<p>poor husband went to that city with the ill-omened name. Go back again</p>
<p>into the women‚Äôs room; if it had been any one else who had woke me up</p>
<p>to bring me such absurd news I should have sent her away with a severe</p>
<p>scolding. As it is your age shall protect you.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear child,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am not mocking you. It is quite</p>
<p>true as I tell you that Ulysses is come home again. He was the stranger</p>
<p>whom they all kept on treating so badly in the cloister. Telemachus</p>
<p>knew all the time that he was come back,</p>
<p>but kept his father‚Äôs secret</p>
<p>that he might have his revenge on all these wicked people.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Penelope sprang up from her couch,</p>
<p>threw her arms round Euryclea,</p>
<p>and wept for joy. ‚ÄúBut my dear nurse,</p>
<p>‚Äù said she,</p>
<p>‚Äúexplain this to me;</p>
<p>if he has really come home as you say,</p>
<p>how did he manage to overcome</p>
<p>the wicked suitors single handed,</p>
<p>seeing what a number of them there</p>
<p>always were?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI was not there,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Euryclea,</p>
<p>‚Äúand do not know; I only heard</p>
<p>them groaning while they were being killed. We sat crouching and</p>
<p>huddled up in a corner of the women‚Äôs room with the doors closed,</p>
<p>till</p>
<p>your son came to fetch me because his father sent him. Then I found</p>
<p>Ulysses standing over the corpses that were lying on the ground all</p>
<p>round him,</p>
<p>one on top of the other. You would have enjoyed it if you</p>
<p>could have seen him standing there all bespattered with blood and</p>
<p>filth,</p>
<p>and looking just like a lion. But the corpses are now all piled</p>
<p>up in the gatehouse that is in the outer court,</p>
<p>and Ulysses has lit a</p>
<p>great fire to purify the house with sulphur. He has sent me to call</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>so come with me that you may both be happy together after all; for</p>
<p>now at last the desire of your heart has been fulfilled; your husband</p>
<p>is come home to find both wife and son alive and well,</p>
<p>and to take his</p>
<p>revenge in his own house on the suitors who behaved so badly to him.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear nurse,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúdo not exult too confidently over all</p>
<p>this. You know how delighted every one would be to see Ulysses come</p>
<p>home‚Äîmore particularly myself,</p>
<p>and the son who has been born to both of</p>
<p>us; but what you tell me cannot be really true. It is some god who is</p>
<p>angry with the suitors for their great wickedness,</p>
<p>and has made an end</p>
<p>of them; for they respected no man in the whole world,</p>
<p>neither rich nor</p>
<p>poor,</p>
<p>who came near them,</p>
<p>and they have come to a bad end in</p>
<p>consequence of their iniquity; Ulysses is dead far away from the</p>
<p>Achaean land; he will never return home again.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then nurse Euryclea said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy child,</p>
<p>what are you talking about? but</p>
<p>you were all hard of belief and have made up your mind that your</p>
<p>husband is never coming,</p>
<p>although he is in the house and by his own</p>
<p>fire side at this very moment. Besides I can give you another proof;</p>
<p>when I was washing him I perceived the scar which the wild boar gave</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>and I wanted to tell you about it,</p>
<p>but in his wisdom he would not</p>
<p>let me,</p>
<p>and clapped his hands over my mouth; so come with me and I will</p>
<p>make this bargain with you‚Äîif I am deceiving you,</p>
<p>you may have me</p>
<p>killed by the most cruel death you can think of.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear nurse,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúhowever wise you may be you can hardly</p>
<p>fathom the counsels of the gods. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>we will go in search of</p>
<p>my son,</p>
<p>that I may see the corpses of the suitors,</p>
<p>and the man who has</p>
<p>killed them.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this she came down from her upper room,</p>
<p>and while doing so she</p>
<p>considered whether she should keep at a distance from her husband and</p>
<p>question him,</p>
<p>or whether she should at once go up to him and embrace</p>
<p>him. When,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>she had crossed the stone floor of the cloister,</p>
<p>she sat down opposite Ulysses by the fire,</p>
<p>against the wall at right</p>
<p>angles180 [to that by which she had entered],</p>
<p>while Ulysses sat near</p>
<p>one of the bearing-posts,</p>
<p>looking upon the ground,</p>
<p>and waiting to see</p>
<p>what his brave wife would say to him when she saw him. For a long time</p>
<p>she sat silent and as one lost in amazement. At one moment she looked</p>
<p>him full in the face,</p>
<p>but then again directly,</p>
<p>she was misled by his</p>
<p>shabby clothes and failed to recognise him,</p>
<p>181 till Telemachus began to</p>
<p>reproach her and said:</p>
<p>‚ÄúMother‚Äîbut you are so hard that I cannot call you by such a name‚Äîwhy</p>
<p>do you keep away from my father in this way? Why do you not sit by his</p>
<p>side and begin talking to him and asking him questions? No other woman</p>
<p>could bear to keep away from her husband when he had come back to her</p>
<p>after twenty years of absence,</p>
<p>and after having gone through so much;</p>
<p>but your heart always was as hard as a stone.‚Äù</p>
<p>Penelope answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy son,</p>
<p>I am so lost in astonishment that I can</p>
<p>find no words in which either to ask questions or to answer them. I</p>
<p>cannot even look him straight in the face. Still,</p>
<p>if he really is</p>
<p>Ulysses come back to his own home again,</p>
<p>we shall get to understand one</p>
<p>another better by and by,</p>
<p>for there are tokens with which we two are</p>
<p>alone acquainted,</p>
<p>and which are hidden from all others.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses smiled at this,</p>
<p>and said to Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúLet your mother put me</p>
<p>to any proof she likes; she will make up her mind about it presently.</p>
<p>She rejects me for the moment and believes me to be somebody else,</p>
<p>because I am covered with dirt and have such bad clothes on; let us,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>consider what we had better do next. When one man has killed</p>
<p>another‚Äîeven though he was not one who would leave many friends to take</p>
<p>up his quarrel‚Äîthe man who has killed him must still say good bye to</p>
<p>his friends and fly the country; whereas we have been killing the stay</p>
<p>of a whole town,</p>
<p>and all the picked youth of Ithaca. I would have you</p>
<p>consider this matter.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúLook to it yourself,</p>
<p>father,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúfor they say you</p>
<p>are the wisest counsellor in the world,</p>
<p>and that there is no other</p>
<p>mortal man who can compare with you. We will follow you with right good</p>
<p>will,</p>
<p>nor shall you find us fail you in so far as our strength holds</p>
<p>out.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will say what I think will be best,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses. ‚ÄúFirst wash</p>
<p>and put your shirts on; tell the maids also to go to their own room and</p>
<p>dress; Phemius shall then strike up a dance tune on his lyre,</p>
<p>so that</p>
<p>if people outside hear,</p>
<p>or any of the neighbours,</p>
<p>or some one going</p>
<p>along the street happens to notice it,</p>
<p>they may think there is a</p>
<p>wedding in the house,</p>
<p>and no rumours about the death of the suitors</p>
<p>will get about in the town,</p>
<p>before we can escape to the woods upon my</p>
<p>own land. Once there,</p>
<p>we will settle which of the courses heaven</p>
<p>vouchsafes us shall seem wisest.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did he speak,</p>
<p>and they did even as he had said. First they washed</p>
<p>and put their shirts on,</p>
<p>while the women got ready. Then Phemius took</p>
<p>his lyre and set them all longing for sweet song and stately dance. The</p>
<p>house re-echoed with the sound of men and women dancing,</p>
<p>and the people</p>
<p>outside said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI suppose the queen has been getting married at last.</p>
<p>She ought to be ashamed of herself for not continuing to protect her</p>
<p>husband‚Äôs property until he comes home.‚Äù182</p>
<p>This was what they said,</p>
<p>but they did not know what it was that had</p>
<p>been happening. The upper servant Eurynome washed and anointed Ulysses</p>
<p>in his own house and gave him a shirt and cloak,</p>
<p>while Minerva made him</p>
<p>look taller and stronger than before; she also made the hair grow thick</p>
<p>on the top of his head,</p>
<p>and flow down in curls like hyacinth blossoms;</p>
<p>she glorified him about the head and shoulders just as a skilful</p>
<p>workman who has studied art of all kinds under Vulcan or Minerva‚Äîand</p>
<p>his work is full of beauty‚Äîenriches a piece of silver plate by gilding</p>
<p>it. He came from the bath looking like one of the immortals,</p>
<p>and sat</p>
<p>down opposite his wife on the seat he had left. ‚ÄúMy dear,</p>
<p>‚Äù said he,</p>
<p>‚Äúheaven has endowed you with a heart more unyielding than woman ever</p>
<p>yet had. No other woman could bear to keep away from her husband when</p>
<p>he had come back to her after twenty years of absence,</p>
<p>and after having</p>
<p>gone through so much. But come,</p>
<p>nurse,</p>
<p>get a bed ready for me; I will</p>
<p>sleep alone,</p>
<p>for this woman has a heart as hard as iron.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Penelope,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI have no wish to set myself up,</p>
<p>nor to</p>
<p>depreciate you; but I am not struck by your appearance,</p>
<p>for I very well</p>
<p>remember what kind of a man you were when you set sail from Ithaca.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,</p>
<p>Euryclea,</p>
<p>take his bed outside the bed chamber that he</p>
<p>himself built. Bring the bed outside this room,</p>
<p>and put bedding upon it</p>
<p>with fleeces,</p>
<p>good coverlets,</p>
<p>and blankets.‚Äù</p>
<p>She said this to try him,</p>
<p>but Ulysses was very angry and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWife,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>am much displeased at what you have just been saying. Who has been</p>
<p>taking my bed from the place in which I left it? He must have found it</p>
<p>a hard task,</p>
<p>no matter how skilled a workman he was,</p>
<p>unless some god</p>
<p>came and helped him to shift it. There is no man living,</p>
<p>however strong</p>
<p>and in his prime,</p>
<p>who could move it from its place,</p>
<p>for it is a</p>
<p>marvellous curiosity which I made with my very own hands. There was a</p>
<p>young olive growing within the precincts of the house,</p>
<p>in full vigour,</p>
<p>and about as thick as a bearing-post. I built my room round this with</p>
<p>strong walls of stone and a roof to cover them,</p>
<p>and I made the doors</p>
<p>strong and well-fitting. Then I cut off the top boughs of the olive</p>
<p>tree and left the stump standing. This I dressed roughly from the root</p>
<p>upwards and then worked with carpenter‚Äôs tools well and skilfully,</p>
<p>straightening my work by drawing a line on the wood,</p>
<p>and making it into</p>
<p>a bed-prop. I then bored a hole down the middle,</p>
<p>and made it the</p>
<p>centre-post of my bed,</p>
<p>at which I worked till I had finished it,</p>
<p>inlaying it with gold and silver; after this I stretched a hide of</p>
<p>crimson leather from one side of it to the other. So you see I know all</p>
<p>about it,</p>
<p>and I desire to learn whether it is still there,</p>
<p>or whether</p>
<p>any one has been removing it by cutting down the olive tree at its</p>
<p>roots.‚Äù</p>
<p>When she heard the sure proofs Ulysses now gave her,</p>
<p>she fairly broke</p>
<p>down. She flew weeping to his side,</p>
<p>flung her arms about his neck,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>kissed him. ‚ÄúDo not be angry with me Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù she cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou,</p>
<p>who are</p>
<p>the wisest of mankind. We have suffered,</p>
<p>both of us. Heaven has denied</p>
<p>us the happiness of spending our youth,</p>
<p>and of growing old,</p>
<p>together;</p>
<p>do not then be aggrieved or take it amiss that I did not embrace you</p>
<p>thus as soon as I saw you. I have been shuddering all the time through</p>
<p>fear that someone might come here and deceive me with a lying story;</p>
<p>for there are many very wicked people going about. Jove‚Äôs daughter</p>
<p>Helen would never have yielded herself to a man from a foreign country,</p>
<p>if she had known that the sons of Achaeans would come after her and</p>
<p>bring her back. Heaven put it in her heart to do wrong,</p>
<p>and she gave no</p>
<p>thought to that sin,</p>
<p>which has been the source of all our sorrows. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that you have convinced me by showing that you know all about</p>
<p>our bed (which no human being has ever seen but you and I and a single</p>
<p>maidservant,</p>
<p>the daughter of Actor,</p>
<p>who was given me by my father on my</p>
<p>marriage,</p>
<p>and who keeps the doors of our room) hard of belief though I</p>
<p>have been I can mistrust no longer.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Ulysses in his turn melted,</p>
<p>and wept as he clasped his dear and</p>
<p>faithful wife to his bosom. As the sight of land is welcome to men who</p>
<p>are swimming towards the shore,</p>
<p>when Neptune has wrecked their ship</p>
<p>with the fury of his winds and waves; a few alone reach the land,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>these,</p>
<p>covered with brine,</p>
<p>are thankful when they find themselves on</p>
<p>firm ground and out of danger‚Äîeven so was her husband welcome to her as</p>
<p>she looked upon him,</p>
<p>and she could not tear her two fair arms from</p>
<p>about his neck. Indeed they would have gone on indulging their sorrow</p>
<p>till rosy-fingered morn appeared,</p>
<p>had not Minerva determined otherwise,</p>
<p>and held night back in the far west,</p>
<p>while she would not suffer Dawn to</p>
<p>leave Oceanus,</p>
<p>nor to yoke the two steeds Lampus and Phaethon that bear</p>
<p>her onward to break the day upon mankind.</p>
<p>At last,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>Ulysses said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWife,</p>
<p>we have not yet reached the end</p>
<p>of our troubles. I have an unknown amount of toil still to undergo. It</p>
<p>is long and difficult,</p>
<p>but I must go through with it,</p>
<p>for thus the</p>
<p>shade of Teiresias prophesied concerning me,</p>
<p>on the day when I went</p>
<p>down into Hades to ask about my return and that of my companions. But</p>
<p>now let us go to bed,</p>
<p>that we may lie down and enjoy the blessed boon</p>
<p>of sleep.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou shall go to bed as soon as you please,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Penelope,</p>
<p>‚Äúnow</p>
<p>that the gods have sent you home to your own good house and to your</p>
<p>country. But as heaven has put it in your mind to speak of it,</p>
<p>tell me</p>
<p>about the task that lies before you. I shall have to hear about it</p>
<p>later,</p>
<p>so it is better that I should be told at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhy should you press me to tell you?</p>
<p>Still,</p>
<p>I will not conceal it from you,</p>
<p>though you will not like it. I</p>
<p>do not like it myself,</p>
<p>for Teiresias bade me travel far and wide,</p>
<p>carrying an oar,</p>
<p>till I came to a country where the people have never</p>
<p>heard of the sea,</p>
<p>and do not even mix salt with their food. They know</p>
<p>nothing about ships,</p>
<p>nor oars that are as the wings of a ship. He gave</p>
<p>me this certain token which I will not hide from you. He said that a</p>
<p>wayfarer should meet me and ask me whether it was a winnowing shovel</p>
<p>that I had on my shoulder. On this,</p>
<p>I was to fix my oar in the ground</p>
<p>and sacrifice a ram,</p>
<p>a bull,</p>
<p>and a boar to Neptune; after which I was</p>
<p>to go home and offer hecatombs to all the gods in heaven,</p>
<p>one after the</p>
<p>other. As for myself,</p>
<p>he said that death should come to me from the</p>
<p>sea,</p>
<p>and that my life should ebb away very gently when I was full of</p>
<p>years and peace of mind,</p>
<p>and my people should bless me. All this,</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>said,</p>
<p>should surely come to pass.‚Äù</p>
<p>And Penelope said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf the gods are going to vouchsafe you a happier</p>
<p>time in your old age,</p>
<p>you may hope then to have some respite from</p>
<p>misfortune.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse. Meanwhile Eurynome and the nurse took torches</p>
<p>and made the bed ready with soft coverlets; as soon as they had laid</p>
<p>them,</p>
<p>the nurse went back into the house to go to her rest,</p>
<p>leaving the</p>
<p>bed chamber woman Eurynome183 to show Ulysses and Penelope to bed by</p>
<p>torch light. When she had conducted them to their room she went back,</p>
<p>and they then came joyfully to the rites of their own old bed.</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>Philoetius,</p>
<p>and the swineherd now left off dancing,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>made the women leave off also. They then laid themselves down to sleep</p>
<p>in the cloisters.</p>
<p>When Ulysses and Penelope had had their fill of love they fell talking</p>
<p>with one another. She told him how much she had had to bear in seeing</p>
<p>the house filled with a crowd of wicked suitors who had killed so many</p>
<p>sheep and oxen on her account,</p>
<p>and had drunk so many casks of wine.</p>
<p>Ulysses in his turn told her what he had suffered,</p>
<p>and how much trouble</p>
<p>he had himself given to other people. He told her everything,</p>
<p>and she</p>
<p>was so delighted to listen that she never went to sleep till he had</p>
<p>ended his whole story.</p>
<p>He began with his victory over the Cicons,</p>
<p>and how he thence reached</p>
<p>the fertile land of the Lotus-eaters. He told her all about the Cyclops</p>
<p>and how he had punished him for having so ruthlessly eaten his brave</p>
<p>comrades; how he then went on to Aeolus,</p>
<p>who received him hospitably</p>
<p>and furthered him on his way,</p>
<p>but even so he was not to reach home,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>to his great grief a hurricane carried him out to sea again; how he</p>
<p>went on to the Laestrygonian city Telepylos,</p>
<p>where the people destroyed</p>
<p>all his ships with their crews,</p>
<p>save himself and his own ship only.</p>
<p>Then he told of cunning Circe and her craft,</p>
<p>and how he sailed to the</p>
<p>chill house of Hades,</p>
<p>to consult the ghost of the Theban prophet</p>
<p>Teiresias,</p>
<p>and how he saw his old comrades in arms,</p>
<p>and his mother who</p>
<p>bore him and brought him up when he was a child; how he then heard the</p>
<p>wondrous singing of the Sirens,</p>
<p>and went on to the wandering rocks and</p>
<p>terrible Charybdis and to Scylla,</p>
<p>whom no man had ever yet passed in</p>
<p>safety; how his men then ate the cattle of the sun-god,</p>
<p>and how Jove</p>
<p>therefore struck the ship with his thunderbolts,</p>
<p>so that all his men</p>
<p>perished together,</p>
<p>himself alone being left alive; how at last he</p>
<p>reached the Ogygian island and the nymph Calypso,</p>
<p>who kept him there in</p>
<p>a cave,</p>
<p>and fed him,</p>
<p>and wanted him to marry her,</p>
<p>in which case she</p>
<p>intended making him immortal so that he should never grow old,</p>
<p>but she</p>
<p>could not persuade him to let her do so; and how after much suffering</p>
<p>he had found his way to the Phaeacians,</p>
<p>who had treated him as though</p>
<p>he had been a god,</p>
<p>and sent him back in a ship to his own country after</p>
<p>having given him gold,</p>
<p>bronze,</p>
<p>and raiment in great abundance. This was</p>
<p>the last thing about which he told her,</p>
<p>for here a deep sleep took hold</p>
<p>upon him and eased the burden of his sorrows.</p>
<p>Then Minerva bethought her of another matter. When she deemed that</p>
<p>Ulysses had had both of his wife and of repose,</p>
<p>she bade gold-enthroned</p>
<p>Dawn rise out of Oceanus that she might shed light upon mankind. On</p>
<p>this,</p>
<p>Ulysses rose from his comfortable bed and said to Penelope,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWife,</p>
<p>we have both of us had our full share of troubles,</p>
<p>you,</p>
<p>here,</p>
<p>in</p>
<p>lamenting my absence,</p>
<p>and I in being prevented from getting home though</p>
<p>I was longing all the time to do so. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that we have at last</p>
<p>come together,</p>
<p>take care of the property that is in the house. As for</p>
<p>the sheep and goats which the wicked suitors have eaten,</p>
<p>I will take</p>
<p>many myself by force from other people,</p>
<p>and will compel the Achaeans to</p>
<p>make good the rest till they shall have filled all my yards. I am now</p>
<p>going to the wooded lands out in the country to see my father who has</p>
<p>so long been grieved on my account,</p>
<p>and to yourself I will give these</p>
<p>instructions,</p>
<p>though you have little need of them. At sunrise it will</p>
<p>at once get abroad that I have been killing the suitors; go upstairs,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>184 and stay there with your women. See nobody and ask no</p>
<p>questions.‚Äù185</p>
<p>As he spoke he girded on his armour. Then he roused Telemachus,</p>
<p>Philoetius,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus,</p>
<p>and told them all to put on their armour also.</p>
<p>This they did,</p>
<p>and armed themselves. When they had done so,</p>
<p>they opened</p>
<p>the gates and sallied forth,</p>
<p>Ulysses leading the way. It was now</p>
<p>daylight,</p>
<p>but Minerva nevertheless concealed them in darkness and led</p>
<p>them quickly out of the town.</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">BOOK XXIV</span>
<p>THE GHOSTS OF THE SUITORS IN HADES‚ÄîULYSSES AND HIS MEN GO TO THE HOUSE</p>
<p>OF LAERTES‚ÄîTHE PEOPLE OF ITHACA COME OUT TO ATTACK ULYSSES,</p>
<p>BUT MINERVA</p>
<p>CONCLUDES A PEACE.</p>
<p>Then Mercury of Cyllene summoned the ghosts of the suitors,</p>
<p>and in his</p>
<p>hand he held the fair golden wand with which he seals men‚Äôs eyes in</p>
<p>sleep or wakes them just as he pleases; with this he roused the ghosts</p>
<p>and led them,</p>
<p>while they followed whining and gibbering behind him. As</p>
<p>bats fly squealing in the hollow of some great cave,</p>
<p>when one of them</p>
<p>has fallen out of the cluster in which they hang,</p>
<p>even so did the</p>
<p>ghosts whine and squeal as Mercury the healer of sorrow led them down</p>
<p>into the dark abode of death. When they had passed the waters of</p>
<p>Oceanus and the rock Leucas,</p>
<p>they came to the gates of the sun and the</p>
<p>land of dreams,</p>
<p>whereon they reached the meadow of asphodel where dwell</p>
<p>the souls and shadows of them that can labour no more.</p>
<p>Here they found the ghost of Achilles son of Peleus,</p>
<p>with those of</p>
<p>Patroclus,</p>
<p>Antilochus,</p>
<p>and Ajax,</p>
<p>who was the finest and handsomest man</p>
<p>of all the Danaans after the son of Peleus himself.</p>
<p>They gathered round the ghost of the son of Peleus,</p>
<p>and the ghost of</p>
<p>Agamemnon joined them,</p>
<p>sorrowing bitterly. Round him were gathered also</p>
<p>the ghosts of those who had perished with him in the house of</p>
<p>Aegisthus; and the ghost of Achilles spoke first.</p>
<p>‚ÄúSon of Atreus,</p>
<p>‚Äù it said,</p>
<p>‚Äúwe used to say that Jove had loved you</p>
<p>better from first to last than any other hero,</p>
<p>for you were captain</p>
<p>over many and brave men,</p>
<p>when we were all fighting together before</p>
<p>Troy; yet the hand of death,</p>
<p>which no mortal can escape,</p>
<p>was laid upon</p>
<p>you all too early. Better for you had you fallen at Troy in the hey-day</p>
<p>of your renown,</p>
<p>for the Achaeans would have built a mound over your</p>
<p>ashes,</p>
<p>and your son would have been heir to your good name,</p>
<p>whereas it</p>
<p>has now been your lot to come to a most miserable end.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHappy son of Peleus,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered the ghost of Agamemnon,</p>
<p>‚Äúfor having</p>
<p>died at Troy far from Argos,</p>
<p>while the bravest of the Trojans and the</p>
<p>Achaeans fell round you fighting for your body. There you lay in the</p>
<p>whirling clouds of dust,</p>
<p>all huge and hugely,</p>
<p>heedless now of your</p>
<p>chivalry. We fought the whole of the livelong day,</p>
<p>nor should we ever</p>
<p>have left off if Jove had not sent a hurricane to stay us. Then,</p>
<p>when</p>
<p>we had borne you to the ships out of the fray,</p>
<p>we laid you on your bed</p>
<p>and cleansed your fair skin with warm water and with ointments. The</p>
<p>Danaans tore their hair and wept bitterly round about you. Your mother,</p>
<p>when she heard,</p>
<p>came with her immortal nymphs from out of the sea,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the sound of a great wailing went forth over the waters so that the</p>
<p>Achaeans quaked for fear. They would have fled panic-stricken to their</p>
<p>ships had not wise old Nestor whose counsel was ever truest checked</p>
<p>them saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄòHold,</p>
<p>Argives,</p>
<p>fly not sons of the Achaeans,</p>
<p>this is his</p>
<p>mother coming from the sea with her immortal nymphs to view the body of</p>
<p>her son.‚Äô</p>
<p>‚ÄúThus he spoke,</p>
<p>and the Achaeans feared no more. The daughters of the</p>
<p>old man of the sea stood round you weeping bitterly,</p>
<p>and clothed you in</p>
<p>immortal raiment. The nine muses also came and lifted up their sweet</p>
<p>voices in lament‚Äîcalling and answering one another; there was not an</p>
<p>Argive but wept for pity of the dirge they chaunted. Days and nights</p>
<p>seven and ten we mourned you,</p>
<p>mortals and immortals,</p>
<p>but on the</p>
<p>eighteenth day we gave you to the flames,</p>
<p>and many a fat sheep with</p>
<p>many an ox did we slay in sacrifice around you. You were burnt in</p>
<p>raiment of the gods,</p>
<p>with rich resins and with honey,</p>
<p>while heroes,</p>
<p>horse and foot,</p>
<p>clashed their armour round the pile as you were</p>
<p>burning,</p>
<p>with the tramp as of a great multitude. But when the flames of</p>
<p>heaven had done their work,</p>
<p>we gathered your white bones at daybreak</p>
<p>and laid them in ointments and in pure wine. Your mother brought us a</p>
<p>golden vase to hold them‚Äîgift of Bacchus,</p>
<p>and work of Vulcan himself;</p>
<p>in this we mingled your bleached bones with those of Patroclus who had</p>
<p>gone before you,</p>
<p>and separate we enclosed also those of Antilochus,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>had been closer to you than any other of your comrades now that</p>
<p>Patroclus was no more.</p>
<p>‚ÄúOver these the host of the Argives built a noble tomb,</p>
<p>on a point</p>
<p>jutting out over the open Hellespont,</p>
<p>that it might be seen from far</p>
<p>out upon the sea by those now living and by them that shall be born</p>
<p>hereafter. Your mother begged prizes from the gods,</p>
<p>and offered them to</p>
<p>be contended for by the noblest of the Achaeans. You must have been</p>
<p>present at the funeral of many a hero,</p>
<p>when the young men gird</p>
<p>themselves and make ready to contend for prizes on the death of some</p>
<p>great chieftain,</p>
<p>but you never saw such prizes as silver-footed Thetis</p>
<p>offered in your honour; for the gods loved you well. Thus even in death</p>
<p>your fame,</p>
<p>Achilles,</p>
<p>has not been lost,</p>
<p>and your name lives evermore</p>
<p>among all mankind. But as for me,</p>
<p>what solace had I when the days of my</p>
<p>fighting were done? For Jove willed my destruction on my return,</p>
<p>by the</p>
<p>hands of Aegisthus and those of my wicked wife.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse,</p>
<p>and presently Mercury came up to them with the</p>
<p>ghosts of the suitors who had been killed by Ulysses. The ghosts of</p>
<p>Agamemnon and Achilles were astonished at seeing them,</p>
<p>and went up to</p>
<p>them at once. The ghost of Agamemnon recognised Amphimedon son of</p>
<p>Melaneus,</p>
<p>who lived in Ithaca and had been his host,</p>
<p>so it began to</p>
<p>talk to him.</p>
<p>‚ÄúAmphimedon,</p>
<p>‚Äù it said,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat has happened to all you fine young men‚Äîall</p>
<p>of an age too‚Äîthat you are come down here under the ground? One could</p>
<p>pick no finer body of men from any city. Did Neptune raise his winds</p>
<p>and waves against you when you were at sea,</p>
<p>or did your enemies make an</p>
<p>end of you on the mainland when you were cattle-lifting or</p>
<p>sheep-stealing,</p>
<p>or while fighting in defence of their wives and city?</p>
<p>Answer my question,</p>
<p>for I have been your guest. Do you not remember how</p>
<p>I came to your house with Menelaus,</p>
<p>to persuade Ulysses to join us with</p>
<p>his ships against Troy? It was a whole month ere we could resume our</p>
<p>voyage,</p>
<p>for we had hard work to persuade Ulysses to come with us.‚Äù</p>
<p>And the ghost of Amphimedon answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúAgamemnon,</p>
<p>son of Atreus,</p>
<p>king</p>
<p>of men,</p>
<p>I remember everything that you have said,</p>
<p>and will tell you</p>
<p>fully and accurately about the way in which our end was brought about.</p>
<p>Ulysses had been long gone,</p>
<p>and we were courting his wife,</p>
<p>who did not</p>
<p>say point blank that she would not marry,</p>
<p>nor yet bring matters to an</p>
<p>end,</p>
<p>for she meant to compass our destruction: this,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>was the</p>
<p>trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room and</p>
<p>began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. ‚ÄòSweethearts,</p>
<p>‚Äô</p>
<p>said she,</p>
<p>‚ÄòUlysses is indeed dead,</p>
<p>still,</p>
<p>do not press me to marry</p>
<p>again immediately; wait‚Äîfor I would not have my skill in needlework</p>
<p>perish unrecorded‚Äîtill I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes,</p>
<p>against the time when death shall take him. He is very rich,</p>
<p>and the</p>
<p>women of the place will talk if he is laid out without a pall.‚Äô This is</p>
<p>what she said,</p>
<p>and we assented; whereupon we could see her working upon</p>
<p>her great web all day long,</p>
<p>but at night she would unpick the stitches</p>
<p>again by torchlight. She fooled us in this way for three years without</p>
<p>our finding it out,</p>
<p>but as time wore on and she was now in her fourth</p>
<p>year,</p>
<p>in the waning of moons and many days had been accomplished,</p>
<p>one</p>
<p>of her maids who knew what she was doing told us,</p>
<p>and we caught her in</p>
<p>the act of undoing her work,</p>
<p>so she had to finish it whether she would</p>
<p>or no; and when she showed us the robe she had made,</p>
<p>after she had had</p>
<p>it washed,</p>
<p>186 its splendour was as that of the sun or moon.</p>
<p>‚ÄúThen some malicious god conveyed Ulysses to the upland farm where his</p>
<p>swineherd lives. Thither presently came also his son,</p>
<p>returning from a</p>
<p>voyage to Pylos,</p>
<p>and the two came to the town when they had hatched</p>
<p>their plot for our destruction. Telemachus came first,</p>
<p>and then after</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>accompanied by the swineherd,</p>
<p>came Ulysses,</p>
<p>clad in rags and</p>
<p>leaning on a staff as though he were some miserable old beggar. He came</p>
<p>so unexpectedly that none of us knew him,</p>
<p>not even the older ones among</p>
<p>us,</p>
<p>and we reviled him and threw things at him. He endured both being</p>
<p>struck and insulted without a word,</p>
<p>though he was in his own house; but</p>
<p>when the will of Aegis-bearing Jove inspired him,</p>
<p>he and Telemachus</p>
<p>took the armour and hid it in an inner chamber,</p>
<p>bolting the doors</p>
<p>behind them. Then he cunningly made his wife offer his bow and a</p>
<p>quantity of iron to be contended for by us ill-fated suitors; and this</p>
<p>was the beginning of our end,</p>
<p>for not one of us could string the</p>
<p>bow‚Äînor nearly do so. When it was about to reach the hands of Ulysses,</p>
<p>we all of us shouted out that it should not be given him,</p>
<p>no matter</p>
<p>what he might say,</p>
<p>but Telemachus insisted on his having it. When he</p>
<p>had got it in his hands he strung it with ease and sent his arrow</p>
<p>through the iron. Then he stood on the floor of the cloister and poured</p>
<p>his arrows on the ground,</p>
<p>glaring fiercely about him. First he killed</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>and then,</p>
<p>aiming straight before him,</p>
<p>he let fly his deadly</p>
<p>darts and they fell thick on one another. It was plain that some one of</p>
<p>the gods was helping them,</p>
<p>for they fell upon us with might and main</p>
<p>throughout the cloisters,</p>
<p>and there was a hideous sound of groaning as</p>
<p>our brains were being battered in,</p>
<p>and the ground seethed with our</p>
<p>blood. This,</p>
<p>Agamemnon,</p>
<p>is how we came by our end,</p>
<p>and our bodies are</p>
<p>lying still uncared for in the house of Ulysses,</p>
<p>for our friends at</p>
<p>home do not yet know what has happened,</p>
<p>so that they cannot lay us out</p>
<p>and wash the black blood from our wounds,</p>
<p>making moan over us according</p>
<p>to the offices due to the departed.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúHappy Ulysses,</p>
<p>son of Laertes,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied the ghost of Agamemnon,</p>
<p>‚Äúyou</p>
<p>are indeed blessed in the possession of a wife endowed with such rare</p>
<p>excellence of understanding,</p>
<p>and so faithful to her wedded lord as</p>
<p>Penelope the daughter of Icarius. The fame,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>of her virtue</p>
<p>shall never die,</p>
<p>and the immortals shall compose a song that shall be</p>
<p>welcome to all mankind in honour of the constancy of Penelope. How far</p>
<p>otherwise was the wickedness of the daughter of Tyndareus who killed</p>
<p>her lawful husband; her song shall be hateful among men,</p>
<p>for she has</p>
<p>brought disgrace on all womankind even on the good ones.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse in the house of Hades deep down within the</p>
<p>bowels of the earth. Meanwhile Ulysses and the others passed out of the</p>
<p>town and soon reached the fair and well-tilled farm of Laertes,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>he had reclaimed with infinite labour. Here was his house,</p>
<p>with a</p>
<p>lean-to running all round it,</p>
<p>where the slaves who worked for him slept</p>
<p>and sat and ate,</p>
<p>while inside the house there was an old Sicel woman,</p>
<p>who looked after him in this his country-farm. When Ulysses got there,</p>
<p>he said to his son and to the other two:</p>
<p>‚ÄúGo to the house,</p>
<p>and kill the best pig that you can find for dinner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I want to see whether my father will know me,</p>
<p>or fail to</p>
<p>recognise me after so long an absence.‚Äù</p>
<p>He then took off his armour and gave it to Eumaeus and Philoetius,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>went straight on to the house,</p>
<p>while he turned off into the vineyard to</p>
<p>make trial of his father. As he went down into the great orchard,</p>
<p>he</p>
<p>did not see Dolius,</p>
<p>nor any of his sons nor of the other bondsmen,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>they were all gathering thorns to make a fence for the vineyard,</p>
<p>at the</p>
<p>place where the old man had told them; he therefore found his father</p>
<p>alone,</p>
<p>hoeing a vine. He had on a dirty old shirt,</p>
<p>patched and very</p>
<p>shabby; his legs were bound round with thongs of oxhide to save him</p>
<p>from the brambles,</p>
<p>and he also wore sleeves of leather; he had a goat</p>
<p>skin cap on his head,</p>
<p>and was looking very woe-begone. When Ulysses saw</p>
<p>him so worn,</p>
<p>so old and full of sorrow,</p>
<p>he stood still under a tall</p>
<p>pear tree and began to weep. He doubted whether to embrace him,</p>
<p>kiss</p>
<p>him,</p>
<p>and tell him all about his having come home,</p>
<p>or whether he should</p>
<p>first question him and see what he would say. In the end he deemed it</p>
<p>best to be crafty with him,</p>
<p>so in this mind he went up to his father,</p>
<p>who was bending down and digging about a plant.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI see,</p>
<p>sir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúthat you are an excellent gardener‚Äîwhat</p>
<p>pains you take with it,</p>
<p>to be sure. There is not a single plant,</p>
<p>not a</p>
<p>fig tree,</p>
<p>vine,</p>
<p>olive,</p>
<p>pear,</p>
<p>nor flower bed,</p>
<p>but bears the trace of</p>
<p>your attention. I trust,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>that you will not be offended if I</p>
<p>say that you take better care of your garden than of yourself. You are</p>
<p>old,</p>
<p>unsavoury,</p>
<p>and very meanly clad. It cannot be because you are idle</p>
<p>that your master takes such poor care of you,</p>
<p>indeed your face and</p>
<p>figure have nothing of the slave about them,</p>
<p>and proclaim you of noble</p>
<p>birth. I should have said that you were one of those who should wash</p>
<p>well,</p>
<p>eat well,</p>
<p>and lie soft at night as old men have a right to do;</p>
<p>but tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>whose bondman are you,</p>
<p>and in whose</p>
<p>garden are you working? Tell me also about another matter. Is this</p>
<p>place that I have come to really Ithaca? I met a man just now who said</p>
<p>so,</p>
<p>but he was a dull fellow,</p>
<p>and had not the patience to hear my story</p>
<p>out when I was asking him about an old friend of mine,</p>
<p>whether he was</p>
<p>still living,</p>
<p>or was already dead and in the house of Hades. Believe me</p>
<p>when I tell you that this man came to my house once when I was in my</p>
<p>own country and never yet did any stranger come to me whom I liked</p>
<p>better. He said that his family came from Ithaca and that his father</p>
<p>was Laertes,</p>
<p>son of Arceisius. I received him hospitably,</p>
<p>making him</p>
<p>welcome to all the abundance of my house,</p>
<p>and when he went away I gave</p>
<p>him all customary presents. I gave him seven talents of fine gold,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>a cup of solid silver with flowers chased upon it. I gave him twelve</p>
<p>light cloaks,</p>
<p>and as many pieces of tapestry; I also gave him twelve</p>
<p>cloaks of single fold,</p>
<p>twelve rugs,</p>
<p>twelve fair mantles,</p>
<p>and an equal</p>
<p>number of shirts. To all this I added four good looking women skilled</p>
<p>in all useful arts,</p>
<p>and I let him take his choice.‚Äù</p>
<p>His father shed tears and answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>you have indeed come to the</p>
<p>country that you have named,</p>
<p>but it is fallen into the hands of wicked</p>
<p>people. All this wealth of presents has been given to no purpose. If</p>
<p>you could have found your friend here alive in Ithaca,</p>
<p>he would have</p>
<p>entertained you hospitably and would have requited your presents amply</p>
<p>when you left him‚Äîas would have been only right considering what you</p>
<p>had already given him. But tell me,</p>
<p>and tell me true,</p>
<p>how many years is</p>
<p>it since you entertained this guest‚Äîmy unhappy son,</p>
<p>as ever was? Alas!</p>
<p>He has perished far from his own country; the fishes of the sea have</p>
<p>eaten him,</p>
<p>or he has fallen a prey to the birds and wild beasts of some</p>
<p>continent. Neither his mother,</p>
<p>nor I his father,</p>
<p>who were his parents,</p>
<p>could throw our arms about him and wrap him in his shroud,</p>
<p>nor could</p>
<p>his excellent and richly dowered wife Penelope bewail her husband as</p>
<p>was natural upon his death bed,</p>
<p>and close his eyes according to the</p>
<p>offices due to the departed. But now,</p>
<p>tell me truly for I want to know.</p>
<p>Who and whence are you‚Äîtell me of your town and parents? Where is the</p>
<p>ship lying that has brought you and your men to Ithaca? Or were you a</p>
<p>passenger on some other man‚Äôs ship,</p>
<p>and those who brought you here have</p>
<p>gone on their way and left you?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúI will tell you everything,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúquite truly. I come</p>
<p>from Alybas,</p>
<p>where I have a fine house. I am son of king Apheidas,</p>
<p>who</p>
<p>is the son of Polypemon. My own name is Eperitus; heaven drove me off</p>
<p>my course as I was leaving Sicania,</p>
<p>and I have been carried here</p>
<p>against my will. As for my ship it is lying over yonder,</p>
<p>off the open</p>
<p>country outside the town,</p>
<p>and this is the fifth year since Ulysses left</p>
<p>my country. Poor fellow,</p>
<p>yet the omens were good for him when he left</p>
<p>me. The birds all flew on our right hands,</p>
<p>and both he and I rejoiced</p>
<p>to see them as we parted,</p>
<p>for we had every hope that we should have</p>
<p>another friendly meeting and exchange presents.‚Äù</p>
<p>A dark cloud of sorrow fell upon Laertes as he listened. He filled both</p>
<p>hands with the dust from off the ground and poured it over his grey</p>
<p>head,</p>
<p>groaning heavily as he did so. The heart of Ulysses was touched,</p>
<p>and his nostrils quivered as he looked upon his father; then he sprang</p>
<p>towards him,</p>
<p>flung his arms about him and kissed him,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúI am he,</p>
<p>father,</p>
<p>about whom you are asking‚ÄîI have returned after having been</p>
<p>away for twenty years. But cease your sighing and lamentation‚Äîwe have</p>
<p>no time to lose,</p>
<p>for I should tell you that I have been killing the</p>
<p>suitors in my house,</p>
<p>to punish them for their insolence and crimes.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf you really are my son Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äù replied Laertes,</p>
<p>‚Äúand have come</p>
<p>back again,</p>
<p>you must give me such manifest proof of your identity as</p>
<p>shall convince me.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirst observe this scar,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhich I got from a boar‚Äôs</p>
<p>tusk when I was hunting on Mt. Parnassus. You and my mother had sent me</p>
<p>to Autolycus,</p>
<p>my mother‚Äôs father,</p>
<p>to receive the presents which when he</p>
<p>was over here he had promised to give me. Furthermore I will point out</p>
<p>to you the trees in the vineyard which you gave me,</p>
<p>and I asked you all</p>
<p>about them as I followed you round the garden. We went over them all,</p>
<p>and you told me their names and what they all were. You gave me</p>
<p>thirteen pear trees,</p>
<p>ten apple trees,</p>
<p>and forty fig trees; you also</p>
<p>said you would give me fifty rows of vines; there was corn planted</p>
<p>between each row,</p>
<p>and they yield grapes of every kind when the heat of</p>
<p>heaven has been laid heavy upon them.‚Äù</p>
<p>Laertes‚Äô strength failed him when he heard the convincing proofs which</p>
<p>his son had given him. He threw his arms about him,</p>
<p>and Ulysses had to</p>
<p>support him,</p>
<p>or he would have gone off into a swoon; but as soon as he</p>
<p>came to,</p>
<p>and was beginning to recover his senses,</p>
<p>he said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúO father</p>
<p>Jove,</p>
<p>then you gods are still in Olympus after all,</p>
<p>if the suitors have</p>
<p>really been punished for their insolence and folly. Nevertheless,</p>
<p>I am</p>
<p>much afraid that I shall have all the townspeople of Ithaca up here</p>
<p>directly,</p>
<p>and they will be sending messengers everywhere throughout the</p>
<p>cities of the Cephallenians.‚Äù</p>
<p>Ulysses answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTake heart and do not trouble yourself about that,</p>
<p>but let us go into the house hard by your garden. I have already told</p>
<p>Telemachus,</p>
<p>Philoetius,</p>
<p>and Eumaeus to go on there and get dinner ready</p>
<p>as soon as possible.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus conversing the two made their way towards the house. When they got</p>
<p>there they found Telemachus with the stockman and the swineherd cutting</p>
<p>up meat and mixing wine with water. Then the old Sicel woman took</p>
<p>Laertes inside and washed him and anointed him with oil. She put him on</p>
<p>a good cloak,</p>
<p>and Minerva came up to him and gave him a more imposing</p>
<p>presence,</p>
<p>making him taller and stouter than before. When he came back</p>
<p>his son was surprised to see him looking so like an immortal,</p>
<p>and said</p>
<p>to him,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy dear father,</p>
<p>some one of the gods has been making you much</p>
<p>taller and better-looking.‚Äù</p>
<p>Laertes answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúWould,</p>
<p>by Father Jove,</p>
<p>Minerva,</p>
<p>and Apollo,</p>
<p>that I</p>
<p>were the man I was when I ruled among the Cephallenians,</p>
<p>and took</p>
<p>Nericum,</p>
<p>that strong fortress on the foreland. If I were still what I</p>
<p>then was and had been in our house yesterday with my armour on,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>should have been able to stand by you and help you against the suitors.</p>
<p>I should have killed a great many of them,</p>
<p>and you would have rejoiced</p>
<p>to see it.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus did they converse; but the others,</p>
<p>when they had finished their</p>
<p>work and the feast was ready,</p>
<p>left off working,</p>
<p>and took each his</p>
<p>proper place on the benches and seats. Then they began eating; by and</p>
<p>by old Dolius and his sons left their work and came up,</p>
<p>for their</p>
<p>mother,</p>
<p>the Sicel woman who looked after Laertes now that he was</p>
<p>growing old,</p>
<p>had been to fetch them. When they saw Ulysses and were</p>
<p>certain it was he,</p>
<p>they stood there lost in astonishment; but Ulysses</p>
<p>scolded them good naturedly and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSit down to your dinner,</p>
<p>old</p>
<p>man,</p>
<p>and never mind about your surprise; we have been wanting to begin</p>
<p>for some time and have been waiting for you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Then Dolius put out both his hands and went up to Ulysses. ‚ÄúSir,</p>
<p>‚Äù said</p>
<p>he,</p>
<p>seizing his master‚Äôs hand and kissing it at the wrist,</p>
<p>‚Äúwe have</p>
<p>long been wishing you home: and now heaven has restored you to us after</p>
<p>we had given up hoping. All hail,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>and may the gods prosper</p>
<p>you.187 But tell me,</p>
<p>does Penelope already know of your return,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>shall we send some one to tell her?‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOld man,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚Äúshe knows already,</p>
<p>so you need not</p>
<p>trouble about that.‚Äù On this he took his seat,</p>
<p>and the sons of Dolius</p>
<p>gathered round Ulysses to give him greeting and embrace him one after</p>
<p>the other; then they took their seats in due order near Dolius their</p>
<p>father.</p>
<p>While they were thus busy getting their dinner ready,</p>
<p>Rumour went round</p>
<p>the town,</p>
<p>and noised abroad the terrible fate that had befallen the</p>
<p>suitors; as soon,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>as the people heard of it they gathered</p>
<p>from every quarter,</p>
<p>groaning and hooting before the house of Ulysses.</p>
<p>They took the dead away,</p>
<p>buried every man his own,</p>
<p>and put the bodies</p>
<p>of those who came from elsewhere on board the fishing vessels,</p>
<p>for the</p>
<p>fishermen to take each of them to his own place. They then met angrily</p>
<p>in the place of assembly,</p>
<p>and when they were got together Eupeithes</p>
<p>rose to speak. He was overwhelmed with grief for the death of his son</p>
<p>Antinous,</p>
<p>who had been the first man killed by Ulysses,</p>
<p>so he said,</p>
<p>weeping bitterly,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy friends,</p>
<p>this man has done the Achaeans great</p>
<p>wrong. He took many of our best men away with him in his fleet,</p>
<p>and he</p>
<p>has lost both ships and men; now,</p>
<p>moreover,</p>
<p>on his return he has been</p>
<p>killing all the foremost men among the Cephallenians. Let us be up and</p>
<p>doing before he can get away to Pylos or to Elis where the Epeans rule,</p>
<p>or we shall be ashamed of ourselves for ever afterwards. It will be an</p>
<p>everlasting disgrace to us if we do not avenge the murder of our sons</p>
<p>and brothers. For my own part I should have no more pleasure in life,</p>
<p>but had rather die at once. Let us be up,</p>
<p>then,</p>
<p>and after them,</p>
<p>before</p>
<p>they can cross over to the main land.‚Äù</p>
<p>He wept as he spoke and every one pitied him. But Medon and the bard</p>
<p>Phemius had now woke up,</p>
<p>and came to them from the house of Ulysses.</p>
<p>Every one was astonished at seeing them,</p>
<p>but they stood in the middle</p>
<p>of the assembly,</p>
<p>and Medon said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHear me,</p>
<p>men of Ithaca. Ulysses did</p>
<p>not do these things against the will of heaven. I myself saw an</p>
<p>immortal god take the form of Mentor and stand beside him. This god</p>
<p>appeared,</p>
<p>now in front of him encouraging him,</p>
<p>and now going furiously</p>
<p>about the court and attacking the suitors whereon they fell thick on</p>
<p>one another.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this pale fear laid hold of them,</p>
<p>and old Halitherses,</p>
<p>son of</p>
<p>Mastor,</p>
<p>rose to speak,</p>
<p>for he was the only man among them who knew both</p>
<p>past and future; so he spoke to them plainly and in all honesty,</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMen of Ithaca,</p>
<p>it is all your own fault that things have turned out as</p>
<p>they have; you would not listen to me,</p>
<p>nor yet to Mentor,</p>
<p>when we bade</p>
<p>you check the folly of your sons who were doing much wrong in the</p>
<p>wantonness of their hearts‚Äîwasting the substance and dishonouring the</p>
<p>wife of a chieftain who they thought would not return. Now,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>let it be as I say,</p>
<p>and do as I tell you. Do not go out against</p>
<p>Ulysses,</p>
<p>or you may find that you have been drawing down evil on your</p>
<p>own heads.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was what he said,</p>
<p>and more than half raised a loud shout,</p>
<p>and at</p>
<p>once left the assembly. But the rest stayed where they were,</p>
<p>for the</p>
<p>speech of Halitherses displeased them,</p>
<p>and they sided with Eupeithes;</p>
<p>they therefore hurried off for their armour,</p>
<p>and when they had armed</p>
<p>themselves,</p>
<p>they met together in front of the city,</p>
<p>and Eupeithes led</p>
<p>them on in their folly. He thought he was going to avenge the murder of</p>
<p>his son,</p>
<p>whereas in truth he was never to return,</p>
<p>but was himself to</p>
<p>perish in his attempt.</p>
<p>Then Minerva said to Jove,</p>
<p>‚ÄúFather,</p>
<p>son of Saturn,</p>
<p>king of kings,</p>
<p>answer me this question‚ÄîWhat do you propose to do? Will you set them</p>
<p>fighting still further,</p>
<p>or will you make peace between them?‚Äù</p>
<p>And Jove answered,</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy child,</p>
<p>why should you ask me? Was it not by your</p>
<p>own arrangement that Ulysses came home and took his revenge upon the</p>
<p>suitors? Do whatever you like,</p>
<p>but I will tell you what I think will be</p>
<p>most reasonable arrangement. Now that Ulysses is revenged,</p>
<p>let them</p>
<p>swear to a solemn covenant,</p>
<p>in virtue of which he shall continue to</p>
<p>rule,</p>
<p>while we cause the others to forgive and forget the massacre of</p>
<p>their sons and brothers. Let them then all become friends as</p>
<p>heretofore,</p>
<p>and let peace and plenty reign.‚Äù</p>
<p>This was what Minerva was already eager to bring about,</p>
<p>so down she</p>
<p>darted from off the topmost summits of Olympus.</p>
<p>Now when Laertes and the others had done dinner,</p>
<p>Ulysses began by</p>
<p>saying,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSome of you go out and see if they are not getting close up to</p>
<p>us.‚Äù So one of Dolius‚Äôs sons went as he was bid. Standing on the</p>
<p>threshold he could see them all quite near,</p>
<p>and said to Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúHere</p>
<p>they are,</p>
<p>let us put on our armour at once.‚Äù</p>
<p>They put on their armour as fast as they could‚Äîthat is to say Ulysses,</p>
<p>his three men,</p>
<p>and the six sons of Dolius. Laertes also and Dolius did</p>
<p>the same‚Äîwarriors by necessity in spite of their grey hair. When they</p>
<p>had all put on their armour,</p>
<p>they opened the gate and sallied forth,</p>
<p>Ulysses leading the way.</p>
<p>Then Jove‚Äôs daughter Minerva came up to them,</p>
<p>having assumed the form</p>
<p>and voice of Mentor. Ulysses was glad when he saw her,</p>
<p>and said to his</p>
<p>son Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚ÄúTelemachus,</p>
<p>now that you are about to fight in an</p>
<p>engagement,</p>
<p>which will show every man‚Äôs mettle,</p>
<p>be sure not to disgrace</p>
<p>your ancestors,</p>
<p>who were eminent for their strength and courage all the</p>
<p>world over.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúYou say truly,</p>
<p>my dear father,</p>
<p>‚Äù answered Telemachus,</p>
<p>‚Äúand you shall</p>
<p>see,</p>
<p>if you will,</p>
<p>that I am in no mind to disgrace your family.‚Äù</p>
<p>Laertes was delighted when he heard this. ‚ÄúGood heavens,</p>
<p>‚Äù he exclaimed,</p>
<p>‚Äúwhat a day I am enjoying: I do indeed rejoice at it. My son and</p>
<p>grandson are vying with one another in the matter of valour.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this Minerva came close up to him and said,</p>
<p>‚ÄúSon of Arceisius‚Äî-best</p>
<p>friend I have in the world‚Äîpray to the blue-eyed damsel,</p>
<p>and to Jove</p>
<p>her father; then poise your spear and hurl it.‚Äù</p>
<p>As she spoke she infused fresh vigour into him,</p>
<p>and when he had prayed</p>
<p>to her he poised his spear and hurled it. He hit Eupeithes‚Äô helmet,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>the spear went right through it,</p>
<p>for the helmet stayed it not,</p>
<p>and his</p>
<p>armour rang rattling round him as he fell heavily to the ground.</p>
<p>Meantime Ulysses and his son fell upon the front line of the foe and</p>
<p>smote them with their swords and spears; indeed,</p>
<p>they would have killed</p>
<p>every one of them,</p>
<p>and prevented them from ever getting home again,</p>
<p>only Minerva raised her voice aloud,</p>
<p>and made every one pause. ‚ÄúMen of</p>
<p>Ithaca,</p>
<p>‚Äù she cried,</p>
<p>‚Äúcease this dreadful war,</p>
<p>and settle the matter at</p>
<p>once without further bloodshed.‚Äù</p>
<p>On this pale fear seized every one; they were so frightened that their</p>
<p>arms dropped from their hands and fell upon the ground at the sound of</p>
<p>the goddess‚Äô voice,</p>
<p>and they fled back to the city for their lives. But</p>
<p>Ulysses gave a great cry,</p>
<p>and gathering himself together swooped down</p>
<p>like a soaring eagle. Then the son of Saturn sent a thunderbolt of fire</p>
<p>that fell just in front of Minerva,</p>
<p>so she said to Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúUlysses,</p>
<p>noble son of Laertes,</p>
<p>stop this warful strife,</p>
<p>or Jove will be angry</p>
<p>with you.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus spoke Minerva,</p>
<p>and Ulysses obeyed her gladly. Then Minerva assumed</p>
<p>the form and voice of Mentor,</p>
<p>and presently made a covenant of peace</p>
<p>between the two contending parties.</p>

<p>very day of the feast given by Orestes. The fact that in the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù</p>
<p>Menelaus came to a banquet without waiting for an invitation,</p>
<p>determines the writer of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù to make him come to a banquet,</p>
<p>also uninvited,</p>
<p>but as circumstances did not permit of his having been</p>
<p>invited,</p>
<p>his coming uninvited is shown to have been due to chance. I do</p>
<p>not think the authoress thought all this out,</p>
<p>but attribute the</p>
<p>strangeness of the coincidence to unconscious cerebration and</p>
<p>saturation.]</p>
<p>[32] [ cf. ‚ÄúIl.‚Äù I. 458,</p>
<p>II. 421. The writer here interrupts an Iliadic</p>
<p>passage (to which she returns immediately) for the double purpose of</p>
<p>dwelling upon the slaughter of the heifer,</p>
<p>and of letting Nestor‚Äôs wife</p>
<p>and daughter enjoy it also. A male writer,</p>
<p>if he was borrowing from the</p>
<p>‚ÄúIliad,</p>
<p>‚Äù would have stuck to his borrowing.]</p>

<p>the dead body of Hector.]</p>

<p>that may be seen in Sicily. The existing ground-plan is probably</p>
<p>unmodified from Odyssean,</p>

<p>but the</p>
<p>earlier buildings would have no arches,</p>
<p>and would,</p>
<p>one would suppose,</p>
<p>be mainly timber. The Odyssean {Greek} were the sheds that ran round</p>
<p>the yard as the arches do now. The {Greek} was the one through which</p>
<p>the main entrance passed,</p>
<p>and which was hence ‚Äúnoisy,</p>
<p>‚Äù or</p>
<p>reverberating. It had an upper story in which visitors were often</p>
<p>lodged.]</p>
<p>[35] [ This journey is an impossible one. Telemachus and Pisistratus</p>
<p>would have been obliged to drive over the Taygetus range,</p>
<p>over which</p>
<p>there has never yet been a road for wheeled vehicles. It is plain</p>
<p>therefore that the audience for whom the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù was written was one</p>
<p>that would be unlikely to know anything about the topography of the</p>
<p>Peloponnese,</p>
<p>so that the writer might take what liberties she chose.]</p>
<p>[36] [ The lines which I have enclosed in brackets are evidently an</p>
<p>afterthought‚Äîadded probably by the writer herself‚Äîfor they evince the</p>
<p>same instinctively greater interest in anything that may concern a</p>
<p>woman,</p>
<p>which is so noticeable throughout the poem. There is no further</p>
<p>sign of any special festivities nor of any other guests than Telemachus</p>
<p>and Pisistratus,</p>
<p>until lines 621-624 (ordinarily enclosed in brackets)</p>
<p>are abruptly introduced,</p>
<p>probably with a view of trying to carry off</p>
<p>the introduction of the lines now in question.</p>
<p>The addition was,</p>
<p>I imagine,</p>
<p>suggested by a desire to excuse and</p>
<p>explain the non-appearance of Hermione in bk. xv.,</p>
<p>as also of both</p>
<p>Hermione and Megapenthes in the rest of bk. iv. Megapenthes in bk. xv.</p>
<p>seems to be still a bachelor: the presumption therefore is that bk. xv.</p>
<p>was written before the story of his marriage here given. I take it he</p>
<p>is only married here because his sister is being married. She having</p>
<p>been properly attended to,</p>
<p>Megapenthes might as well be married at the</p>
<p>same time. Hermione could not now be less than thirty.</p>

<p>understands them as one. The catalogue in the ‚ÄúIliad,</p>

<p>is here presumably following,</p>
<p>makes the same mistake (‚ÄúIl.‚Äù ii. 581,</p>

<p>one known in the Odyssean age. See ‚ÄúThe Authoress of the Odyssey,</p>

<p>Cypria about Paris and Helen robbing Menelaus of the greater part of</p>
<p>his treasures,</p>
<p>when they sailed together for Troy.]</p>
<p>[42] [ It is inconceivable that Helen should enter thus,</p>
<p>in the middle</p>

<p>[44] [ The Greek is {Greek}. Is it unfair to argue that the writer is a</p>

<p>273-288,</p>
<p>to the effect that she gave herself airs and would marry none</p>
<p>of her own people. For that the writer of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù was the person</p>
<p>who has been introduced into the poem under the name of Nausicaa,</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>cannot bring myself to question. I may remind English readers that</p>

<p>Phocaean coins.]</p>
<p>[46] [ Surely here again we are in the hands of a writer of delicate</p>
<p>sensibility. It is not as though the seals were stale; they had only</p>

<p>however is obviously laughing at her own</p>
<p>countrymen,</p>
<p>and insulting them as openly as she dares.]</p>

<p>[48] [ I give the usual translation,</p>

<p>will warrant it. The Greek reads {Greek}.</p>
<p>This is usually held to mean that Ithaca is an island fit for breeding</p>
<p>goats,</p>
<p>and on that account more delectable to the speaker than it would</p>
<p>have been if it were fit for breeding horses. I find little authority</p>
<p>for such a translation; the most equitable translation of the text as</p>
<p>it stands is,</p>
<p>‚ÄúIthaca is an island fit for breeding goats,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>delectable rather than fit for breeding horses; for not one of the</p>
<p>islands is good driving ground,</p>

<p>does not mean that a pleasant or delectable island would not be fit for</p>
<p>breeding horses? The most equitable translation,</p>
<p>therefore,</p>
<p>of the</p>
<p>present text being thus halt and impotent,</p>
<p>we may suspect corruption,</p>
<p>and I hazard the following emendation,</p>
<p>though I have not adopted it in</p>
<p>my translation,</p>
<p>as fearing that it would be deemed too fanciful. I</p>
<p>would read:‚Äî{Greek}.</p>
<p>As far as scanning goes the {Greek} is not necessary; {Greek} iv. 72,</p>
<p>(Footnote Greek) iv. 233,</p>
<p>to go no further afield than earlier lines of</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">the same book,</span>
<p>give sufficient authority for {Greek},</p>
<p>but the {Greek}</p>
<p>would not be redundant; it would emphasise the surprise of the</p>
<p>contrast,</p>
<p>and I should prefer to have it,</p>
<p>though it is not very</p>
<p>important either way. This reading of course should be translated</p>
<p>‚ÄúIthaca is an island fit for breeding goats,</p>
<p>and (by your leave) itself</p>
<p>a horseman rather than fit for breeding horses‚Äîfor not one of the</p>
<p>islands is good and well meadowed ground.‚Äù</p>
<p>This would be sure to baffle the Alexandrian editors. ‚ÄúHow,</p>
<p>‚Äù they would</p>
<p>ask themselves,</p>
<p>‚Äúcould an island be a horseman?‚Äù and they would cast</p>
<p>about for an emendation. A visit to the top of Mt. Eryx might perhaps</p>
<p>make the meaning intelligible,</p>
<p>and suggest my proposed restoration of</p>
<p>the text to the reader as readily as it did to myself.</p>
<p>I have elsewhere stated my conviction that the writer of the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù</p>
<p>was familiar with the old Sican city at the top of Mt. Eryx,</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>the Aegadean islands which are so striking when seen thence did duty</p>
<p>with her for the Ionian islands‚ÄîMarettimo,</p>
<p>the highest and most</p>
<p>westerly of the group,</p>
<p>standing for Ithaca. When seen from the top of</p>
<p>Mt. Eryx Marettimo shows as it should do according to ‚ÄúOd.‚Äù ix. 25,</p>
<p>26,</p>
<p>‚Äúon the horizon,</p>
<p>all highest up in the sea towards the West,</p>
<p>‚Äù while the</p>
<p>other islands lie ‚Äúsome way off it to the East.‚Äù As we descend to</p>
<p>Trapani,</p>
<p>Marettimo appears to sink on to the top of the island of</p>
<p>Levanzo,</p>
<p>behind which it disappears. My friend,</p>
<p>the late Signor E.</p>
<p>Biaggini,</p>
<p>pointed to it once as it was just standing on the top of</p>
<p>Levanzo,</p>
<p>and said to me ‚ÄúCome cavalca bene‚Äù (‚ÄúHow well it rides‚Äù),</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>this immediately suggested my emendation to me. Later on I found in the</p>
<p>hymn to the Pythian Apollo (which abounds with tags taken from the</p>
<p>‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù) a line ending {Greek} which strengthened my suspicion that</p>
<p>this was the original ending of the second of the two lines above under</p>
<p>consideration.]</p>

<p>fact that though Trapanese sailors had given her a fair idea as to</p>
<p>where all her other localities really were,</p>
<p>no one in those days more</p>
<p>than in our own could localise the Planctae,</p>

<p>sailors‚Äô tales about the difficulties of navigating the group of the</p>
<p>Aeolian islands as a whole (see note on ‚ÄúOd.‚Äù x. 3). Still the matter</p>
<p>of the poor doves caught her fancy,</p>
<p>so she would not forgo them. The</p>
<p>whirlwinds of fire and the smoke that hangs on Scylla suggests allusion</p>
<p>to Stromboli and perhaps even Etna. Scylla is on the Italian side,</p>

<p>therefore may be said to look West. It is about 8 miles thence to the</p>

<p>it not immediately easy to make Euryclea scan in xvii. 495,</p>
<p>she hastily</p>
<p>called her Eurynome,</p>
<p>intending either to alter this name later or to</p>
<p>change the earlier Euryclea‚Äôs into Eurynome. She then drifted in to</p>
<p>Eurynome as convenience further directed,</p>
<p>still nevertheless hankering</p>
<p>after Euryclea,</p>
<p>till at last she found that the path of least</p>
<p>resistance would lie in the direction of making Eurynome and Euryclea</p>
<p>two persons. Therefore in xxiii. 289-292 both Eurynome and ‚Äúthe nurse‚Äù</p>
<p>(who can be none other than Euryclea) come on together. I do not say</p>
<p>that this is feminine,</p>
<p>but it is not unfeminine.]</p>
<p>[157] [ See note [156]]</p>
<p>[158] [ This,</p>
<p>I take it,</p>
<p>was immediately in front of the main entrance</p>
<p>of the inner courtyard into the body of the house.]</p>
<p>[159] [ This is the only allusion to Sardinia in either ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù or</p>
<p>‚ÄúOdyssey.‚Äù]</p>
<p>[160] [ The normal translation of the Greek word would be ‚Äúholding</p>
<p>back,</p>
<p>‚Äù ‚Äúcurbing,</p>
<p>‚Äù ‚Äúrestraining,</p>
<p>‚Äù but I cannot think that the writer</p>
<p>meant this‚Äîshe must have been using the word in its other sense of</p>
<p>‚Äúhaving,</p>
<p>‚Äù ‚Äúholding,</p>
<p>‚Äù ‚Äúkeeping,</p>
<p>‚Äù ‚Äúmaintaining.‚Äù]</p>
<p>[161] [ I have vainly tried to realise the construction of the</p>
<p>fastening here described.]</p>
<p>[162] [ See plan of Ulysses‚Äô house in the appendix. It is evident that</p>
<p>the open part of the court had no flooring but the natural soil.]</p>
<p>[163] [ See plan of Ulysses‚Äô house,</p>
<p>and note [175].]</p>
<p>[164] [ i.e. the door that led into the body of the house.]</p>
<p>[165] [ This was,</p>
<p>no doubt,</p>
<p>the little table that was set for Ulysses,</p>
<p>‚ÄúOd.‚Äù xx. 259.</p>
<p>Surely the difficulty of this passage has been overrated. I suppose the</p>
<p>iron part of the axe to have been wedged into the handle,</p>
<p>or bound</p>
<p>securely to it‚Äîthe handle being half buried in the ground. The axe</p>
<p>would be placed edgeways towards the archer,</p>
<p>and he would have to shoot</p>
<p>his arrow through the hole into which the handle was fitted when the</p>
<p>axe was in use. Twelve axes were placed in a row all at the same</p>
<p>height,</p>
<p>all exactly in front of one another,</p>
<p>all edgeways to Ulysses</p>
<p>whose arrow passed through all the holes from the first onward. I</p>
<p>cannot see how the Greek can bear any other interpretation,</p>
<p>the words</p>
<p>being,</p>
<p>{Greek}</p>
<p>‚ÄúHe did not miss a single hole from the first onwards.‚Äù {Greek}</p>
<p>according to Liddell and Scott being ‚Äúthe hole for the handle of an</p>
<p>axe,</p>
<p>etc.,</p>
<p>‚Äù while {Greek} (‚ÄúOd.‚Äù v. 236) is,</p>
<p>according to the same</p>
<p>authorities,</p>
<p>the handle itself. The feat is absurdly impossible,</p>
<p>but</p>
<p>our authoress sometimes has a soul above impossibilities.]</p>
<p>[166] [ The reader will note how the spoiling of good food distresses</p>
<p>the writer even in such a supreme moment as this.]</p>
<p>[167] [ Here we have it again. Waste of substance comes first.]</p>
<p>[168] [ cf. ‚ÄúIl.‚Äù iii. 337 and three other places. It is strange that</p>
<p>the author of the ‚ÄúIliad‚Äù should find a little horse-hair so alarming.</p>
<p>Possibly enough she was merely borrowing a common form line from some</p>
<p>earlier poet‚Äîor poetess‚Äîfor this is a woman‚Äôs line rather than a</p>
<p>man‚Äôs.]</p>
<p>[169] [ Or perhaps simply ‚Äúwindow.‚Äù See plan in the appendix.]</p>
<p>[170] [ i.e. the pavement on which Ulysses was standing.]</p>
<p>[171] [ The interpretation of lines 126-143 is most dubious,</p>
<p>and at</p>
<p>best we are in a region of melodrama: cf.,</p>
<p>however,</p>
<p>i. 425,</p>
<p>etc. from</p>
<p>which it appears that there was a tower in the outer court,</p>
<p>and that</p>
<p>Telemachus used to sleep in it. The ·ΩÄœÅœÉŒøŒ∏œçœÅŒ± I take to be a door,</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>trap door,</p>
<p>leading on to the roof above Telemachus‚Äôs bed room,</p>
<p>which we</p>
<p>are told was in a place that could be seen from all round‚Äîor it might</p>
<p>be simply a window in Telemachus‚Äôs room looking out into the street.</p>
<p>From the top of the tower the outer world was to be told what was going</p>
<p>on,</p>
<p>but people could not get in by the ·ΩÄœÅœÉŒøŒ∏œçœÅŒ±: they would have to</p>
<p>come in by the main entrance,</p>
<p>and Melanthius explains that the mouth of</p>
<p>the narrow passage (which was in the lands of Ulysses and his friends)</p>
<p>commanded the only entrance by which help could come,</p>
<p>so that there</p>
<p>would be nothing gained by raising an alarm.</p>
<p>As for the ·ø•·ø∂Œ≥ŒµœÇ of line 143,</p>
<p>no commentator ancient or modern has</p>
<p>been able to say what was intended‚Äîbut whatever they were,</p>
<p>Melanthius could never carry twelve shields,</p>
<p>twelve helmets,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>twelve spears. Moreover,</p>
<p>where he could go the others could go</p>
<p>also. If a dozen suitors had followed Melanthius into the house</p>
<p>they could have attacked Ulysses in the rear,</p>
<p>in which case,</p>
<p>unless</p>
<p>Minerva had intervened promptly,</p>
<p>the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù would have had a</p>
<p>different ending. But throughout the scene we are in a region of</p>
<p>extravagance rather than of true fiction‚Äîit cannot be taken</p>
<p>seriously by any but the very serious,</p>
<p>until we come to the episode</p>
<p>of Phemius and Medon,</p>
<p>where the writer begins to be at home again.]</p>
<p>[172] [ I presume it was intended that there should be a hook driven</p>
<p>into the bearing-post.]</p>
<p>[173] [ What for?]</p>
<p>[174] [ Gr: {Greek}. This is not {Greek}.]</p>
<span class="chapter-marker">[175] [ From lines 333 and 341 of this book,</span>
<p>and lines 145 and 146 of</p>
<p>bk. xxi we can locate the approach to the {Greek} with some certainty.]</p>
<p>[176] [ But in xix. 500-502 Ulysses scolded Euryclea for offering</p>
<p>information on this very point,</p>
<p>and declared himself quite able to</p>
<p>settle it for himself.]</p>
<p>[177] [ There were a hundred and eight Suitors.]</p>
<p>[178] [ Lord Grimthorpe,</p>
<p>whose understanding does not lend itself to</p>
<p>easy imposition,</p>
<p>has been good enough to write to me about my</p>
<p>conviction that the ‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù was written by a woman,</p>
<p>and to send me</p>
<p>remarks upon the gross absurdity of the incident here recorded. It is</p>
<p>plain that all the authoress cared about was that the women should be</p>
<p>hanged: as for attempting to realise,</p>
<p>or to make her readers realise,</p>
<p>how the hanging was done,</p>
<p>this was of no consequence. The reader must</p>
<p>take her word for it and ask no questions. Lord Grimthorpe wrote:</p>
<p>‚ÄúI had better send you my ideas about Nausicaa‚Äôs hanging of the maids</p>
<p>(not ‚Äòmaidens,</p>
<p>‚Äô of whom Froude wrote so well in his ‚ÄòScience of</p>
<p>History‚Äô) before I forget it all. Luckily for me Liddell &amp; Scott have</p>
<p>specially translated most of the doubtful words,</p>
<p>referring to this very</p>
<p>place.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA ship‚Äôs cable. I don‚Äôt know how big a ship she meant,</p>
<p>but it must</p>
<p>have been a very small one indeed if its ‚Äòcable‚Äô could be used to tie</p>
<p>tightly round a woman‚Äôs neck,</p>
<p>and still more round a dozen of them ‚Äòin</p>
<p>a row,</p>
<p>‚Äô besides being strong enough to hold them and pull them all up.</p>
<p>‚ÄúA dozen average women would need the weight and strength of more than</p>
<p>a dozen strong heavy men even over the best pulley hung to the roof</p>
<p>over them; and the idea of pulling them up by a rope hung anyhow round</p>
<p>a pillar {Greek} is absurdly impossible; and how a dozen of them could</p>
<p>be hung dangling round one post is a problem which a senior wrangler</p>
<p>would be puzzled to answer... She had better have let Telemachus use</p>
<p>his sword as he had intended till she changed his mind for him.‚Äù]</p>
<p>[179] [ Then they had all been in Ulysses‚Äô service over twenty years;</p>
<p>perhaps the twelve guilty ones had been engaged more recently.]</p>
<p>[180] [ Translation very doubtful‚Äîcf. ‚ÄúIt.‚Äù xxiv. 598.]</p>
<p>[181] [ But why could she not at once ask to see the scar,</p>
<p>of which</p>
<p>Euryclea had told her,</p>
<p>or why could not Ulysses have shown it to her?]</p>
<p>[182] [ The people of Ithaca seem to have been as fond of carping as</p>
<p>the Phaeacians were in vi. 273,</p>
<p>etc.]</p>
<p>[183] [ See note [156]. Ulysses‚Äôs bed room does not appear to have been</p>
<p>upstairs,</p>
<p>nor yet quite within the house. Is it possible that it was</p>
<p>‚Äúthe domed room‚Äù round the outside of which the erring maids were,</p>
<p>for</p>
<p>aught we have heard to the contrary,</p>
<p>still hanging?]</p>
<p>[184] [ Ulysses bedroom in the mind of the writer is here too</p>
<p>apparently down stairs.]</p>
<p>[185] [ Penelope having been now sufficiently whitewashed,</p>
<p>disappears</p>
<p>from the poem.]</p>
<p>[186] [ So practised a washerwoman as our authoress doubtless knew that</p>
<p>by this time the web must have become such a wreck that it would have</p>
<p>gone to pieces in the wash.]</p>
<p>A lady points out to me,</p>
<p>just as these sheets are leaving my hands,</p>
<p>that no really good needlewoman‚Äîno one,</p>
<p>indeed,</p>
<p>whose work or character</p>
<p>was worth consideration‚Äîcould have endured,</p>
<p>no matter for what reason,</p>
<p>the unpicking of her day‚Äôs work,</p>
<p>day after day for between three and</p>
<p>four years.]</p>
<p>[187] [ We must suppose Dolius not yet to know that his son Melanthius</p>
<p>had been tortured,</p>
<p>mutilated,</p>
<p>and left to die by Ulysses‚Äô orders on the</p>
<p>preceding day,</p>
<p>and that his daughter Melantho had been hanged. Dolius</p>
<p>was probably exceptionally simple-minded,</p>
<p>and his name was ironical. So</p>
<p>on Mt. Eryx I was shown a man who was always called Sonza Malizia or</p>
<p>‚ÄúGuileless‚Äù‚Äîhe being held exceptionally cunning.]</p>

<p>Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>public support and donations to carry out its mission of</p>
<p>increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be</p>
<p>freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest</p>
<p>array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations</p>
<p>($1 to $5,</p>
<p>000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt</p>
<p>status with the IRS.</p>
<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating</p>
<p>charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United</p>
<p>States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a</p>
<p>considerable effort,</p>
<p>much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up</p>
<p>with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations</p>
<p>where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND</p>
<p>DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state</p>
<p>visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we</p>
<p>have not met the solicitation requirements,</p>
<p>we know of no prohibition</p>
<p>against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who</p>
<p>approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>International donations are gratefully accepted,</p>
<p>but we cannot make</p>
<p>any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from</p>
<p>outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other</p>
<p>ways including checks,</p>
<p>online payments and credit card donations. To</p>
<p>donate,</p>
<p>please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
